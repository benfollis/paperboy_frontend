    "title": "Ramadan: Fasting safely during coronavirus crisis - BBC News",
    "text": "Millions of people around the world will be observing the \"holy month\" of Ramadan under lockdown this year.  Each year, many practising Muslims fast from dawn to dusk for the whole of the lunar month - either 29 or 30 days - as part of the ritual of dedicating oneself to contemplation and prayer.  Fasting is obligatory for all adult followers of the faith who are able to safely go without food and drink. But there are some considerations when it comes to fasting during a pandemic. Fighting infection takes a lot of energy, University of Sussex immunologist Dr Jenna Macciochi says. And prolonged periods of not eating or drinking can weaken the immune system. So it is important to make sure you get enough calories during the hours you are permitted to eat - and achieve an \"energy balance\" of: And it is a good idea to eat a variety of food, including lots of different coloured vegetables, fruits, pulses and legumes.   There is also some risk in becoming dehydrated, as it can affect the mucus that lines your airways and acts as a protective barrier.  But looking after other aspects of your health by trying to get enough sleep and exercise and de-stressing where possible can help keep your immune system functioning as it should. More simply though, the best way to protect your health is preventing exposure to the virus.  Much of the risk can be avoided by handwashing and, for those who can, staying at home.   People who are ill, including those with Covid-19, are exempt from fasting.  And it is not recommended for people with certain long-term conditions such as diabetes with complications.  Diabetes UK head of care Daniel Howarth said the decision was \"absolutely a personal reflection\" but there were some precautions people with well managed conditions who wanted to fast could take, including eating slower-release carbohydrates, such as wholegrain bread and rice, and testing your blood sugar more often.  The Muslim Council of Britain has published guidance, saying \"healthcare staff required to provide care to Covid-19 patients, at real risk of dehydration and making clinical errors due to wearing PPE [personal protective equipment] and long shifts\" are exempt from fasting.  Although not consuming enough calories in a day can lower your immune response, the effect of fasting on the immune system is not straightforward.   The immune system is not one thing with an on/off switch.  It is a complicated series of mechanisms that have to be kept in balance. Fasting releases the stress hormone cortisol, which can suppress some immune responses.  But there is also good evidence from studies in mice that intermittent fasting of the kind practised during Ramadan can speed up the body's process of regeneration, causing old cells to die and be replaced with new ones.  However, it is difficult to translate this evidence to humans.  And it is not clear how long you would have to fast to replicate the effect.  Follow Rachel  on Twitter",

    "text": "A submarine crew were filmed having a party during the coronavirus lockdown, prompting a Royal Navy investigation. The captain of HMS Trenchant, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based at Devonport in Plymouth, has been sent home on leave. Video of the crew enjoying a party and barbecue while the submarine was tied up have been shared on social media. It shows sailors dancing and laughing, and a source confirmed some were drinking alcohol. HMS Trenchant had been on patrol before having to return to Devonport to undergo repairs. The crew were required to stay with the submarine in isolation while the repairs were completed. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said it was understood the captain had gone ahead with the entertainment despite being advised it might be inappropriate. A Royal Navy spokesman said: \"An investigation is under way. It would be inappropriate to comment further.\"",

    "title": "Coronavirus: 'Our wedding has been cancelled but we still have to pay for it' - BBC News",
    "text": "Brides and grooms say they are being charged thousands of pounds in cancellation and postponement fees for weddings that can't go ahead because of the coronavirus lockdown.   While the majority of wedding companies across the UK have been flexible, a growing number of couples across the UK are locked in a battle with venues to get their money back. Adam Gibbs, 36, and Sarah Summerskill, 33, from Woking, were told their dream day in May was off because of social distancing restrictions, but they would still have to pay the venue an 80% cancellation charge.  They had been planning their wedding for the last 18 months and were supposed to get married at Cain Manor in Surrey on 9 May - one of five venues part of the Bijou Weddings group. Their wedding package costs total \u00a317,000, and the couple has so far paid \u00a313,000. However, the venue has now cancelled the event and told them to pay a cancellation fee amounting to 80% of the total cost of the wedding, as listed in their wedding contract. They were advised to claim the money back on insurance and then re-book the wedding. But the couple has had their insurance claim declined on the basis that cancellation of the wedding and closure of the venue arose from a government order, and they feel \"lost and hopeless\". \"The venue has still got \u00a313,000 of our money and are still demanding additional payments [to fulfil the cancellation charge] in the next week. It's not the kind of money you find down the back of the sofa,\" Mr Gibbs told the BBC. \"It's seems nonsensical to us that a venue can cancel on us and then charge us 80% [of the cost] without delivering a service.\" Initially, Bijou Weddings told the couple that they needed to pay the full cancellation charge for the wedding package, which amounts to \u00a313,600. Since the couple had paid \u00a313,000, this would mean they still owed the wedding company another \u00a3600. But Bijou Weddings then said it would be willing to rebook their wedding date on another date in 2020 free of charge.  Bijou Weddings says that if customers are able to make insurance claims and get the cancellation fees refunded, then it will offer alternative dates later on this year or in 2021 or 2022 for rebooked weddings, and the new wedding would be charged at 2019 package prices. The company said it would also throw in a free bar float of \u00a31,000. And for customers who do not have insurance or could not claim on insurance, Bijou Weddings says it will rebook weddings free of charge and offer alternative dates, but only during 2020, and the wedding dates could not be on Fridays or Saturdays.  Some couples are still unhappy with the options given to them by Bijou Weddings though.  Jack Trowsdale, 27, and Claudia Dickens, 25, from West Sussex had already paid \u00a321,000 for their wedding on 12 June at Botleys Mansion - another Bijou venue - when it was cancelled.  \"We'd saved for so long and hard for it and then not only to find the wedding is cancelled, but to be told they think you owe them money for a wedding that didn't even happen. It's beyond belief almost,\" said Mr Trowsdale.  The couple have both had their wages and hours reduced at work because of the virus. They told the BBC the excitement of planning their big day has been replaced by the stress of a full legal dispute. They have since been offered an alternative wedding date on a weekday at no extra cost, but are seeking a full refund as \"the ordeal has shattered\" their hopes of a special day. Sam Cutmore-Scott, managing director of Bijou Weddings said: \"In our 25 years delivering weddings, this is the first time our venues have been forced to close. I should point out that Bijou has not voluntarily or arbitrarily cancelled any weddings - it has been forced to close its venues and halt weddings caught in the government's social distancing restrictions. \"We have thus tried to accommodate the needs of couples who are immediately impacted, while still respecting our commitments to clients who have weddings booked in 2021 and beyond.\" He added that a majority of couples had successfully re-booked for a later date.  But Bijou Weddings defended its decision to keep the cancellation charges: \"Cancellation charges protect us from cancellations in an industry where the average engagement and advance booking period is around 23 months.  \"Couples protect themselves from unforeseen circumstances by taking out wedding insurance which, in the normal course of events, covers cancellations that are caused by circumstances beyond the couple's control. \"We sent cancellation charge information to all our impacted couples so that any with insurance could make a claim and make themselves whole again.  \"We have not followed up or chased cancellation charges during this crisis period and, for those couples who do not have insurance or whose insurance is shirking their responsibilities, we have offered a broad variety of postponement options with no charge or rearrangement fee.\" Due to existing bookings for next year, other wedding venues are finding it increasingly difficult to reschedule cancelled weddings for equivalent weekends in 2021. Jenny Maybury, 39, and Michael Bromwich, 36, both from the Midlands, had their wedding moved from a Sunday in May, to a Wednesday in September.  Only 12 of the 75 guests could make the new date in September, so Jenny decided to ask the hotel for a refund of \u00a35,355. The venue, Abel's Harp in Shropshire, told the couple no weekends were available, but has refused to compensate them for the difference in price, or for a reduction in the number of guests. Unfortunately the couple do not have insurance for their wedding. \"They've backed us into a corner and taken it out of our control. We feel angry and heartbroken,\" said Ms Maybury. Another couple, Debra Bingham and her fianc\u00e9 Jamie, who had booked the same venue, told the BBC they were told they'd have to pay \u00a31,500 to move the date they had chosen this year to 2021, on top of what they had already paid. Abel's Harp did not respond when approached by the BBC for comment.  Lorraine Carroll has been in the wedding industry for over 30 years and is currently advising 250 brides and grooms who are in dispute with 15 different venues across the UK.  She accuses a small minority of venues acting \"appallingly\", trying to profit through the coronavirus disruption and \"making rules and fees up as they go along\".  \"Clients are being treated disgraceful by venues and insurers are finding ways of avoiding paying out. Couples face losing thousands of pounds,\" she said.  The Competition and Markets Authority has previously warned the wedding sector that excessive cancellation charges, even when contracts had been signed, are not legally binding.  In 2016, the authority, which ensures businesses treat customers fairly, wrote to more than 100 wedding and event venues reminding them of consumer protection laws. The CMA says it is prepared to \"use the tools at its disposal to intervene\". Consumer rights group Which? says it has received complaints from other couples about wedding venue cancellations.  \"It is unacceptable that some venues are refusing to provide any refund of couples' significant upfront deposits or charging customers extortionate fees, particularly when it is not the couples' decision to cancel,\" said Adam French, Consumer Rights Editor at Which?. \"While many businesses will be struggling during this difficult time, it does not seem fair for customers to be charged fees or left thousands of pounds out of pocket for a service the venue can't deliver.\" He added that businesses should take a \"compassionate and flexible approach\".

    "title": "Afghanistan: The detention centre for teenage Taliban members - BBC News",
    "text": "In a dusty courtyard, behind a tall mesh fence, a group of teenagers are playing a frenetic game of football, while others stand around watching from the sidelines. These are some of Afghanistan's most vulnerable and most troubled children. Inmates of Kabul's Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre. A small, excited crowd of boys press their faces up to the fence to talk to us.  \"Some of us killed people\u2026 some of us are thieves,\" one lanky teenager tells me when I ask what they are accused of. They're smiling and laughing but they aren't the most serious cases here. The centre generally holds approximately 300 inmates, aged between 12 and 18. On average, around half are accused of being in militant groups: the Islamic State (IS) or the Taliban. The Taliban control or contest around half of Afghanistan, they've been waging a deadly war against the Afghan government and US-led international forces since being overthrown in 2001. The staff try and keep the categories of detainees separate, to avoid fights between those linked to the Taliban and to the Islamic State group - which have clashed with each other in the outside world - and to prevent the boys accused of \"general crimes\" from becoming radicalised. The boys talking to me in the courtyard all live on the ground floor of the bright green accommodation block. The Taliban and IS members are held in the two floors above them. \"They're terrorists, we are not,\" says one dismissively. The BBC was given rare access to the centre, surrounded by high concrete walls, with watchtowers and armed guards dotted around the periphery. In a quiet corner, a social worker introduces us to three alleged IS members. The group is newer, and far less powerful in Afghanistan than the Taliban, but has been responsible for dozens of deadly suicide bombings. One, wearing an electric blue salwar kameez, and with a glare in his eyes, claims he was wrongly arrested. Many of the boys in the centre are wary about revealing their past activities, even though we are keeping their identities anonymous. Nevertheless, he gradually opens up about his extreme views. \"The foreigners haven't done anything wrong to me, but the Prophet has said jihad against them must continue until the Day of Judgement.\" The extent of his radicalisation becomes even clearer as he explains why he hates the Afghan government - allied to US-led international forces. \"This is an Islamic country, but look at Kabul, it's full of brothels. There is so much adultery and homosexuality. There are musicians and, god forbid, there are even people having sex with their own mothers and sisters.\" He's from a province in the east of the country, and his description of the Afghan capital Kabul as a pit of debauchery bears no resemblance to reality. Yet it's clear it's something he deeply believes.   At the same time, there's a softer side to him too. Despite only having the beginnings of a beard growing on his face, he's a father to a one-year-old girl. \"I don't want her to see me here, she will cry,\" he says. As the interview ends and we walk off, we pass the cells of the accommodation block. In one, a group of boys are dangling their legs out between the blue metal bars of the window, singing a song and hammering out a beat on a small plastic jug. They giggle as they tell me the song is about \"love\", but I notice many of them have tattoos scratched onto their wrists, arms or ankles. Some are crude images of guns or daggers, one - in Persian - reads \"have a bad life, and an even worse future\"; another, \"kill to survive\".  Kabul suffers from high levels of crime, with kidnappings and violent robberies common. Unemployment amongst young people is at more than 30% according to the World Bank.  \"Kill to survive?\" I ask. \"Is that what you feel life is like?\"   The mood has momentarily grown more serious. \"If you work as a labourer you only earn 200 Afghani (\u00a32) a day, how can you feed your family?\" one asks. \"You have to steal and rob.\" Then, another strikes up his song again, and we leave them giggling in their cell. The following day, we meet a dizzying stream of boys, an IS recruit who joined up after seeing their propaganda on social media, a 17-year-old Taliban fighter who smilingly asserts that he has killed \"lots\" of American soldiers - a claim that's almost definitely not true.   One of the boys that stands out is Zakir, a tall, gangly 14-year-old. He looks like a rather dopey teenager, whose deep voice seems too old for his youthful face. But he's proud of his links to the Taliban. \"My job was to plant explosives,\" he tells me. \"The Taliban used to come to the village at night time and I would give them reports about what was going on.\" Zakir says he joined the group after seeing \"how they prayed and looked after people\" when visiting relatives in areas under their control, and watching Taliban propaganda videos.   He tells me he joined \"secretly\" and that his family never knew. In fact, his father and elder brother were fighting on the other side of the conflict, as members of the Afghan intelligence services. Was he never worried the explosives he planted could end up killing his own father? He insisted he operated in areas his father never visited, targeting instead local pro government militias who he accused of \"raping and stealing\".  Zakir, like many of the boys, seemed to have a good relationship with the staff at the centre. But he was clear that he wanted to join the Taliban again.   \"Here, we pray five times a day, and have lessons. But when I'm free I will look after my parents, and then I will join the Taliban again. They are fighting for the truth.\" Some of his words sounded as if they were copied from propaganda videos. But there were also glimpses of how child-like he was.   What would he do if his parents forbade him from rejoining the Taliban? \"Then I won't\u2026 but when they die, I will.\" The staff try to deradicalise the boys. There's a school in the centre, with lessons taking place behind thick metal doors, in what used to be cells.   One of the most popular subjects is Islamic studies. Mubashir Nazari is a heavy set man, with a cropped beard. He's leading a class of around 25 boys - many accused of being in the Taliban or IS - who are reciting Quranic verses.  He admits it's not easy to change their minds, but says the lessons do make a difference. \"When they first come to the centre, and they hear that there's been a suicide attack in Kabul, they are happy and say, 'do you see how many people we have killed? This is jihad'. \"Then we ask them, 'what is the sin of those children killed in the blast? Or the people just going to work?'. And we say, 'where in Islam does it permit you to kill innocent people?'. By the end, when they hear of a suicide attack they get upset.\" There are also lessons in academic subjects, with basic literacy taught for those who have never been to school before. Abdullah, a slim 16-year-old, with bright eyes, and a small traditional cap perched atop his head, tells me he spent two months with the Taliban, and was arrested on his way to a shootout between the group and security forces in western Afghanistan.   He was inspired to sign up when he and his friends began attending a madrassa, or religious school, in his area, which was under the control of the Taliban. \"The preacher said it's your duty to fight and die in the name of Allah,\" he says. But now, Abdullah is one of the centre's best students, despite having little to no formal education in the past.   \"I'm in Class 10, and waiting for my results so I can move into Class 11,\" he says with pride. \"The Taliban just put ammunition in your hand and tell you to fight, but when I am released from here I want to keep studying.\"  For staff trying to form relationships with boys like Abdullah, one of the biggest problems is the high turn-over in inmates. Detainees are regularly released or transferred, whilst there's a constant stream of fresh arrivals. One morning, we watch as the intelligence services drop off a small boy, his head shaved, wrists still in handcuffs. He looks extremely nervous as he's taken to the medical centre to be registered. In an almost inaudible voice, he tells them he's suffering from psychological problems. The doctor taking down his details says mental health issues are common.   He tells me he often sees boys who have self harmed, cutting their bodies or faces. \"Every week there's two or three cases\u2026. They do it with whatever they can find - pieces of glass or metal.\" \"I think almost all of them have gone through something traumatic and haven't had the ability to process it, so their response to it is fighting,\" Lyla Schwartz, a foreign psychologist with the Etidal Foundation, explains. \"Finding something to be a part of in order to get their anger and frustration out, instead of actually acknowledge how much loss they've experienced.\" Ms Schwartz tries to get the boys to address their underlying trauma, but she's stretched for time. \"We always address the crises first - suicide attempts, fighting, riots - but there are some kids that we really have built relationships with. If we had the support and resources, we could go more in depth.\"   Fourteen-year-old Mohammad looks particularly nervous He led a small group of friends running away from an IS camp they were forced into, and is worried about other boys - with extremist views - overhearing us. His parents both died, and he ended up in the care of his sister and his brother-in-law. The brother-in-law joined IS, and took Mohammad with him to the group's stronghold in the east of Afghanistan. There, he enrolled him in a madrassa. \"They pretend to be good Muslims,\" he says, \"but they are not doing good things.\" \"Like what?\" I ask.  \"Killing children,\" he replies. It's not clear what he witnessed himself, and what he's simply heard about - he doesn't want to go into details - but later in the conversation, he again refers to IS \"killing kids\".   Mohammed says he tried to run away with a handful of others. \"But we were arrested by IS and put in jail\u2026 They beat us and said, 'you want to join the infidels'.\"  When they could, they tried to escape again. \"We knew if we were discovered we would be killed\u2026 We walked all night through the hills and the next day we handed ourselves in.\"  But while Mohammad is relieved he's no longer in the madrassa, he's frustrated that he's being kept in the detention centre. \"We thought we would go home, but instead they put us here.\"  Aside from lessons in the morning, and a short period in the courtyard, the boys spend their days in their rooms.   Zakir, the 14-year-old Taliban member, shares his cell with nine others, all accused of being in the militant group.   Their favourite pastime? Beadwork.   Zakir shows me a tiny pair of sandals he's made for his younger sister, using red and white beads that are stuck together, others have decorated pens or made prayer beads for their parents. I use the opportunity to ask Zakir more about life growing up in a warzone.   \"I've been seeing dead bodies ever since I can remember,\" he tells me in a flat tone. One episode stands out for him. When he was eight, one of his friends was killed by his own parents, for getting involved with local criminals. It's a reminder that the violence in Afghanistan isn't just restricted to the war.   How and why Zakir ended up joining the Taliban is confusing. His father, whilst working for the intelligence services, was injured in an attack by the group when Zakir was 13. He remembers his parents trying to hide the fact from him. \"My father said he was bitten by a dog, but later on I found out that wasn't true.\"  But despite what happened to his father, Zakir says he began to support the Taliban. \"I knew my father was in the wrong, for supporting the foreigners,\" he tells me.  One of the main reasons he joined the group, he says, was because he was being harassed by local pro-government militia forces. \"If you are dressed like a religious Muslim with a skullcap, they arrest you, beat you and humiliate you.\"   Once with the Taliban, he felt \"safer\". \"Before joining the Taliban, I would get upset when I was beaten and ask why is this happening to me? But when I was with the Taliban, it was better, because at least then there was reason - we were enemies.\" It's hard to know if all that is true, but Zakir seems genuine. He's conflicted about what he wants to do with his future. He's \"proud\" of his time with the Taliban, but adds: \"Perhaps I won't do it again, as there are other fighters\u2026 I want to continue my jihad, but not if my parents are unhappy.\"  The centre does try and prepare the boys for life on the outside - there's a tailoring workshop for example.   But once they've been released there's no system for checking up on them. It's a source of frustration for Ms Schwartz. \"There are supposed to be social workers who follow up with them,\" she says, but security concerns make it difficult for that to happen. \"Support, school, jobs, alternatives to what they've come from, is extremely lacking.\" Justice Minister Abdul Baseer Anwar - who ultimately has control of the centre - recognises the need to rehabilitate the boys. \"The psychologists,\" he says, \"are even more important than the clerics\" in fighting against the \"brainwashing\" done by militants.  Mr Anwar adds that he's looking at introducing new regulations that would make it easier to help find the detainees stable jobs after release. He hopes the international community can help both with more funding and expertise.  Abdullah, the former Taliban member who has excelled in his studies, is due for release and worries about what will happen next. \"I won't go back to my village,\" he tells me. \"The Taliban would kill me.\"  But others in the centre show little sign of changing their views. On our final day, one peering out of the window of his cell on the third floor, points to me and runs his fingers across his neck. \"I'll slit your throat,\" he shouts down. It's a reminder of the challenges faced by the Afghan authorities in reintegrating those with extremist views into the rest of society. The Taliban and US signed an agreement in February aimed at beginning to bring an end to the conflict. In the next stage of the peace process, talks between the insurgents and the government about the future of the country are due to begin, though fighting between them continues.   The boys in the centre linked to the Taliban celebrated the deal as a victory, staying awake late at night offering special prayers. Many hope now to eventually be released as part of a prisoner exchange that belatedly began earlier this month, although both sides have accused each other of not fully abiding by its terms.  Zakir, with a mixture of stubbornness and innocence, insists that the war in Afghanistan will end when American troops leave as Afghans are all \"brothers\". But he acknowledges he wants the Taliban's interpretation of an Islamic state established in the country, despite the fact many other Afghans clearly don't. Other boys I speak to make clear they believe their \"jihad\" will continue until sharia law is established. When we ask Zakir what he thinks about democracy, he's instantly dismissive.  \"Nonsense,\" he replies.   All the teenagers' names have been changed",

    "text": " (CNN) While soldiers are patrolling the streets of Bucharest, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep has been adjusting to a new, different pace of life. Romania, an eastern European country of 21 million, has been in a state of emergency since March 16 to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Everyone over the age of 65 has to stay at home while the rest of the country is only allowed to leave home for essential shopping or work, provided they carry a letter from their employers. A night-time curfew has also been enforced.  \"I have not been going out at all,\" Halep, the reigning Wimbledon champion from Romania, told CNN Sport from her home in Bucharest. \"I am definitely a person who takes these things very seriously and is nervous about them. The lockdown has been very strict here in Romania, we have had military on the streets and are not allowed to go outside.\"  Halep was born in the Black Sea resort of Constanta, and her 2018 victory at Roland-Garros turned the 28-year-old into a superstar in Romania. She received a huge homecoming after beating 23-time major singles winner Serena Williams in the finals of Wimbledon last year, celebrating her victory with 30,000 fans at Bucharest National Stadium. She was even rewarded with her own postage stamp.    READ: Murray predicts tennis will be 'one of the last sports to get back to normality' Medical equipment Halep is well aware that tennis is not the most important thing in the world right now. Romania had reported 498 deaths from 9,242 confirmed infections with the coronavirus as of April 22, according to the  Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Cente r.  \"It has been a scary situation here in Romania,\" said Halep. \"I try not to watch too much or read too much in the news as I find it very worrying; I prefer to focus on helping where I can,\" said Halep, who donated medical equipment to hospitals in Constanta and Bucharest last month. \"And playing my part by staying inside, and of course staying positive and strong.\" READ: Nadal is left confused by Instagram Live 'We can only dream of playing a Grand Slam' Although Halep said she misses the women's tour, her colleagues and playing events, she isn't optimistic tennis will resume any time soon.  All professional tennis has been put on hold until at least July 13 because of the pandemic. Wimbledon has been canceled for the first time since World War II, while the French Open, where she is a three-time finalist, has moved its start date from May 24 to September 20.  \"I believe that if we are playing tennis again in September we have already won, because it means the threat of the virus will be over,\" Halep said. \"We can only dream of playing a grand slam at this point, but I support the tournament and of course I will look forward to playing if we can.\" The hardest part for Halep is the uncertainty. \"It's definitely strange not to know when we will be able to play tournaments again,\" said Halep. \"Which surface will we play on? In which country? There are no answers right now, so it's difficult to plan ahead.\" READ: Andy Murray says 'Big Three' are greatest players of all time Late nights The coronavirus pandemic has forced Halep to slow down. For the first time in years, her schedule is no longer dictated by daily training sessions, traveling to tournaments, sponsorship and media obligations or playing matches.

    "title": "Giant asteroid flying by Earth next week looks like it's wearing a face mask - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) An asteroid estimated to be 1.2 miles wide will fly by Earth next week, but it's not expected to collide with our planet.  And if an asteroid could be aware of such things, it appears to be wearing a face mask in deference to the pandemic, according to new images from Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.  The asteroid is called  52768 (1998 OR2) , and it was first spotted in 1998.  On April 29, it will pass within 3,908,791 miles of Earth, moving at 19,461 miles per hour. That's still 16 times farther than the distance between Earth and the moon. If it did impact Earth, the asteroid is \"large enough to cause global effects,\" according to  NASA , back when the asteroid was first discovered.  \"The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,\" said Anne Virkki, head of planetary radar at Arecibo Observatory, in a statement. \"But since we are all thinking about Covid-19, these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.\" The flyby is expected to occur on Wednesday, April 29, at 5:56 a.m. ET, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. The center tracks Near-Earth Objects, or NEOs, that could collide with Earth. Arecibo Observatory is a National Science Foundation facility managed by the University of Central Florida. A team of experts has been monitoring this near-Earth asteroid, among others. The observatory is supported by NASA's Near-Earth Object Observations Program and has been analyzing asteroids since the mid-'90s.  During the pandemic, scientists at Arecibo are continuing to make their observations on behalf of planetary defense. In line with social distancing, they have limited the number of scientists and radar operators at the facility, and they're wearing masks during observations. The asteroid was classified as a potentially hazardous object because it's bigger than 500 feet and comes within 5 million miles of Earth's orbit. The experts at Arecibo can monitor the asteroids and use observations to determine their path in the future to see if they pose a risk to Earth. \"The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,\" said Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory, in a statement. \"In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.\" It's the largest asteroid expected to zip by Earth within the next two months, but it's not the largest ever.  That honor belongs to the asteroid 3122 Florence (1981 ET3), which flew by and  luckily missed colliding with Earth  on September 1, 2017. It will make another pass again on September 2, 2057. That asteroid is estimated to be between two and a half and five and a half miles wide. ",

    "text": "New Delhi (CNN) For years, northern India -- especially the capital New Delhi --  has been battling air pollution  with levels hitting the hazardous mark during the winter season. Now, during a  nationwide coronavirus lockdown , air pollution in the region has dropped to a 20-year low, according to  data published by NASA .  In a series of maps, NASA plotted the aerosol levels in northern India during the same six-day period of March 31 to April 5 from 2016 to 2020. \"We knew we would see changes in atmospheric composition in many places during the lockdown,\" said Pawan Gupta, a Universities Space Research Association scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \"But I have never seen aerosol values so low in the Indo-Gangetic Plain at this time of year.\" The Indo-Gangetic Plain stretches across the north of India. The report tracks the aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is the measure of how light is absorbed or reflected by airborne particles as it travels through the atmosphere. According to the report: \"AOD levels in northern India at the beginning of April were significantly below the norm for this time of year and the lowest in 20 years of MODIS observations. Ground observation stations in India have also  reported  a decrease in particle pollution in the region\".  MODIS is an instrument used to monitor large-scale changes, such as what proportion of the earth's surface is covered by clouds each day. The drop in pollution levels comes as India enters its fifth week of lockdown. On March 25, the Indian government imposed a strict nationwide lockdown halting all construction activities, public transport and industry.  India isn't the only place to see cleaner air. Lockdowns restricting travel and industry imposed to halt the spread of coronavirus have resulted in unprecedented reductions in deadly air pollution around the world, new analysis shows.",

    "title": "Prince Louis rainbow pictures released to mark his second birthday  - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) The  Royal Family  has released photographs of  Prince Louis  painting rainbows to mark his second birthday. Several photos taken by his mother Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge earlier this month and shared by Kensington Palace on Instagram and Twitter on Thursday, show the prince with rainbow colored paint on his hands.  One of the photos shows a painting of a rainbow, with an accompanying caption on Twitter reading: \"Sharing a sneak peek of Prince Louis's handiwork ahead of his second birthday.\" The palace also thanked people for their birthday wishes, sharing an \"Instagram vs reality\" post on Twitter of the young prince's face covered in paint. In Britain, the rainbow has become a symbol of hope during the coronavirus crisis as the country battles to stem the spread of the virus, which to date has claimed 18,100 lives in the country, according to the  latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.  Children across the country have been painting rainbows and placing them in windows to display to passersby, or drawing them in chalk on pavements and walls to spread the message of hope and remind people to stay home. Prince Louis, who is fifth in line to the throne and the youngest of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's three children, was born on April 23 2018 at a hospital in Paddington, west London. Last year, Kensington Palace released a set of photographs, also taken by Catherine,  to mark his first birthday.  The images were taken at their family home in Norfolk, in the east of England. Earlier this month Prince William and Catherine dialed in for a video call to  spread some cheer  to teachers and pupils at Casterton Primary Academy in Lancashire, northwestern England, which remains open for children of key workers, including National Health Service staff. The UK has been in lockdown since March 24 when Prime Minister Boris Johnson,  who is currently recovering after being treated for Covid-19 in intensive care , issued a stay-at-home order, warning people could only leave their homes for shopping, one form of exercise or for work if they have to.",

    "text": " (CNN) Time to hit rewind. The first ever  YouTube video  was uploaded on April 23, 2005 -- exactly 15 years ago, today. YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim posted the 18-second video, titled \"Me at the zoo.\" It has since garnered over 90 million views. To this day, it is the only video on Karim's channel.  Upon clicking play, the screen fills with a young Karim's face, his disheveled hair taking up the screen front and center. \"Alright,\" Karim begins. \"So here we are, in front of the elephants.\" There he is. In front of the elephants. \"The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long, um, trunks,\" he continues. \"And that's, that's cool.\" So. True.  Unlike many YouTube creators' videos these days, Karim's video does not include what's considered the more traditional sign off: \"Subscribe to my channel!\" or \"Like, rate, comment!\"  He ends the video simply by stating: \"And that's pretty much all there is to say.\" A year after \"Me at the zoo,\" Karim and fellow co-founders  sold the platform to Google for a whopping $1.65 billion.  Now, the platform boasts more than 2 billion logged-in users visit each month,  according to YouTube.  In the past decade and a half, YouTube has seen many highs and lows. Among the lows: A surge in  hate speech videos  (including videos by  prominent white supremacists ); drama around certain creators (including PewDiePie, one YouTube's biggest stars who faced  allegations of racism and anti-Semitism ); and  frustration from some creators . Among the highs: Helping elevate  creators  (from Smosh to Miranda Sings); launching  YouTube Red , a streaming service with original TV shows and movies; and becoming a hub for all kinds of content. YouTube says  one billion hours of content is watched daily .  And it all began with Karim, at the zoo.",

    "title": "Ford engineers are working on electric Mustang SUVs in their own garages - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) When Aleyna Kapur started working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, she had to take a few things from the office: her laptop, some cables and a Ford Mustang Mach-E electric SUV.  The first SUV ever to carry the Mustang name, the  Mach-E was unveiled  to the public in November. With an emphasis on affordability and performance, the electric crossover is seen as Ford's attempt to take on Tesla. At the time, Ford said the Mach-E would go on sale by fall of this year.   But a few months later, on March 13, the pandemic spurred  Ford   ( F )  to order its employees to start working from home.  So Kapur and her colleagues brought home more than a dozen pre-production versions of the Mach-E SUVs, as well as computer equipment and other gear so they could keep working from their basements, living rooms, garages and neighborhood streets.   There's still a lot of work left to be done to get the vehicle ready for production by the deadline -- but no one intends to miss it.  Kapur is a calibrator. Her job is to make sure all the computer software controlling the Mach-E's electric motors responds as it's supposed to, under every conceivable circumstance. If done incorrectly, the vehicle might not start and stop smoothly, struggle over different   types of   terrain, or some parts might overheat or malfunction in extreme weather. \"There are like thousands and thousands and thousands of lines of code written so that way we can optimize the vehicle to respond properly during all these different situations,\" Kapur explained.   It's one thing for a   consultant or a journalist to work at home when all that's needed is a laptop, a phone and an internet connection. But Kapur and her colleagues are working on a roughly 4,500 pound SUV with battery packs holding up to nearly 100 kilowatt hours of energy.  The Mach-E is the first Ford model designed and engineered purely as an electric vehicle. Previously, Ford's electrics have been electric versions of vehicles that were also sold with gasoline engines. Kapur said she spends, on average, about half her time working at her desk and the other half driving the Mach-E around her neighborhood while recording streams of performance data. It varies, though, from days when she never leaves her desk to whole days spent in the Mach-E.  \"Generally, I would say, I'm in the vehicle at least once a day, but there's still quite a lot that we get done online,\" she said. The computer she uses at her office is far more powerful than what   she has at home, she said, but she can still   use a secure Internet connection to access that office machine for   more   demanding data analysis. Before the pandemic, when Kapur and her team were working at the office, anyone could jump into any test vehicle. Some of the Mach Es are   rear-wheel-drive, some are all-wheel-drive and some have larger, more powerful battery packs than others. Each version requires different software calibrations.  Now, with everyone working from home, each test vehicle is in a different driveway or garage,   meaning communication is crucial. Team members must   ask one another to run specific driving tests if they need data from a version of the Mach-E they don't have. \"A lot of times we're able to, like, go around the block,\" she said. \"And most of us who have a vehicle are using it to do any sort of necessary errands.\"  Other engineers are working on the Mach-E's \"infotainment\" systems, the internal computer screens that have controls for navigation, entertainment and climate   settings. They brought home desktop   mockups that include the Mach-E's long vertical screen with a circular knob installed at the bottom. They can operate them at their desks as they would in the vehicle. The designers and engineers working on the Mach-E can be thankful the stay-at-home orders came at this point in the Mach-E's development process. The so-called pre-production vehicles, largely hand-built examples, had already been made. For the most part, the Mach-E just needs some refinements. But there were some tests that required a test track. Even as Michigan was shutting down, Ford was able to shift   some of those tests elsewhere, said Darren Palmer, Ford's electric vehicle development programs. \"We've got facilities all over the world,\" said Palmer. \"And as the different places have different effects from coronavirus we were able to make use of those facilities.\" Once this is all over, there remain other crucial tests, like crash tests, which   need to be done in controlled environments. With computer modeling, the tests should mostly confirm what the engineers already expect, Palmer said, based on having run virtual tests on computers. Still, the real tests must be done. \"You must do that check,\" he said, \"but you don't expect that you're going to get much change required from those, anymore.\" While waiting for access to those test environments, the engineers and designers are working on what they can do from home. Some work is getting completed faster, Palmer said, since people have access to their computers and vehicles at all hours. Employees are driving their test Mach-Es on the weekends when they wouldn't normally have access to them. However, if the coronavirus lockdown lasts longer than expected, the start of Mustang Mach-E production in the fall of 2020 might need to be delayed, Ford has said.",

    "title": "Black women sue a Pennsylvania golf course that called cops alleging they were playing too slow  - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) Two African American women who allege that management at a Pennsylvania golf course mistreated them when they  called police because they were playing too slow  have now filed a lawsuit claiming racial and gender discrimination. Myneca Ojo and Karen Crosby, two of the five women involved in the 2018 incident, filed the lawsuit on Monday against Brew Vino LLC, which owns Grandview Golf Course, as well as several employees involved. The lawsuit alleges that an owner told a member of their group that they weren't keeping pace and treated them differently than other players on the course, who the lawsuit says were Caucasian and male.  The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and requests compensatory and punitive damages but does not list a specific amount.  An investigation by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission found that the women had probable cause that they were \"profiled, harassed, evicted and subjected to different terms and conditions of service because of their protected classes,\" and granted them the right to sue, according to the lawsuit.  CNN has reached out to Brew Vino for comment but has not received a response.   Women were told they weren't following policy, lawsuit says According to the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the plaintiffs had recently bought memberships to the golf course and decided to put them to use for the first time on April 21, 2018. Although their group was one person more than the Grandview's usual limit, the person who checked them in allowed them to proceed. Frost had delayed play earlier in the day, the lawsuit says, so their tee time was pushed from 10 a.m. until sometime between 10:39 a.m. and 11:12 a.m.  Once they were two holes in the game, Steve Chronister, who identified himself as the owner of the course, told one member of the group that they were moving too slowly, the lawsuit alleges. The women contend in the lawsuit that they weren't playing slowly, and say one of them told Chronister that he was treating them differently than the other players on the course. After this interaction, the lawsuit alleges that Chronister called 911 to say they weren't following policy. An officer came to the location, but Chronister asked her not to confront them because they had moved ahead, the lawsuit says. After completing the first nine holes, three of the five women left because of their experience earlier in the day, the lawsuit alleges. Myneca Ojo and Sandra Thompson continued playing the rest of the course, the lawsuit says. When another group arrived at tenth tee at the same time as them, the lawsuit states, the group told them to go ahead because they were taking a break. When the women started to play, Jordan Chronister, an employee at Grandview, came up to the women and told them they could not \"cut people off,\" according to the lawsuit. Both Thompson and a man from the other group explained the situation, but an argument started between the women and management, which was captured on video, the lawsuit says. Grandview attempted to refund the cost of their memberships on the spot, but the women declined. At this point, Steve Chronister called 911 again, the lawsuit says. It is unclear if the women left on their own or were escorted by police. Steve and Jordan Chronister, as well as the other defendants in the lawsuit, did not respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit cites information from a PHRC hearing in which a golfer in the group immediately behind the women stated his group was not held up and that he felt the women were being targeted.  The lawsuit also claims that Steve Chronister defamed the women in public statements to the media, specifically in regard to a comment made to the York Daily Record in February of this year, after the PHRC ruling giving the women the right to sue. \"Throughout the hearings, the five accusers testified under oath and before this kangaroo court, asserting the false claims and ultimately committing perjury, which I can prove,\" Steve Chronister was quoted as saying in a February 25 article.   Two years later In a statement to CNN, the lawyers representing Ojo and Crosby said that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission made an objective determination that their clients were harassed, and therefore are continuing to federal court. \"The civil rights violations undertook by representatives of Grandview Golf Course against our clients in April of 2018 continue to shock the conscience of civil-minded Americans,\" attorneys John L. Rollins and Mary H. Powell said. Crosby told CNN Wednesday she is \"relieved and happy\" by the suit. \"Feels like we will have some sort of closure to this situation,\" Crosby said. She also said since the incident they eventually stopped golfing because they \"didn't feel comfortable doing it.\" \"This is a small area and there was a lot attention brought to it, we just didn't feel comfortable doing it,\" she said, adding that she occasionally would golf with her husband. \"Hopefully this year we will be able to play again once this dies down, we'd like to.\" Sandra Harrison and Carolyn Dow filed a similar lawsuit against the golf course Tuesday, citing discrimination in a place of public accommodation and discrimination in performance of contract, according to court documents filed in the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  Ian Bryson, their attorney, told CNN Thursday they are also asking for a declarative judgment that they were discriminated against instead of just a monetary judgment.  \"It's hard to put a value on someone's civil rights, it's not just about money,\" he said. \"But about vindication of civil rights.\" He also said Harrison and Dow \"are interested in getting a resolution more than anything\" when asked how they were feeling about the lawsuit. Thompson, one of the golfers, told CNN Thursday she filed a writ of summons -- a precursor to filing a complaint -- in the York County Court of Common Pleas. Asked about filing a suit in the future Thompson, also an attorney, said, \"Who knows, since they filed already, what may happen.\"",

    "text": " (CNN) The Southern severe weather streak continues Thursday with yet another round of extreme weather possible  a day after storms killed at least six people in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Hundreds of tornadoes have been reported across the eastern half of the US in April, most occurring across the Deep South. A tornado that touched down Wednesday evening in southern Oklahoma killed two people and injured a number of others, according to officials.  Several vehicles were thrown into trees and there was damage to two steel manufacturing companies, Robert Chaney, director of Marshall County Emergency Management, said. In Polk County, Texas, a tornado produced by a strong supercell thunderstorm killed three people and injured 20 to 30 others, according to county officials. A disaster declaration issued after the county was hit said there was significant damage to residential structures, commercial structures and public infrastructure. That thunderstorm moved across Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. A woman was killed in Woodworth, Louisiana, during Wednesday evening's storms. During the storm's journey, a tornado warning was active at various periods across all three states. In total the cell covered approximately 240 miles. 4 tornado safety tips that could save your life >>> A supercell is a thunderstorm that can last for several hours and have a high tendency to produce severe weather, including damaging winds, very large hail, and sometimes weak to violent tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service.  The service will have to determine exactly how many tornadoes the storm could have produced across the three states.  The preliminary number of tornadoes reported from Wednesday morning through Thursday early morning is 25. There were at least 51,716 outages reported in Mississippi and 36,974 in Louisiana Thursday morning, according to  poweroutage.us. Get your local forecast >>> What's expected Thursday The weather service's Storm Prediction Center says there is an \"enhanced risk\" -- level 3 out of 5 -- of severe weather in parts of northern Florida, southern Georgia, and far southern South Carolina.  Risks include tornadoes and severe wind. Track the storms with CNN's storm tracker >>> A lesser risk of severe weather exists Thursday elsewhere in those states, as well as in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Storms were hitting parts of Alabama and Georgia on Thursday morning and should race across Georgia and Florida through the rest of the afternoon. A second wave of storms could arrive Thursday afternoon and evening, according to forecast models.  For the second wave, hail and damaging winds could hit, especially in parts of southeastern Mississippi and southern Alabama, the Storm Prediction Center says. Flooding is an additional threat  The flooding potential will be higher with this round of storms because many of the locations that will see rain are already saturated from the last rain event a few days ago. One to 3 inches of rain per hour is possible across parts of Alabama and Georgia, increasing to 2 to 3 inches per hour across eastern South Carolina.   Expect flash flooding and ponding on the roadways for these areas.",

    "text": " (CNN) If you find yourself in tears watching the visual for Alicia Keys' new song, know that the singer had the same reaction the first time she saw it. The 15-time Grammy winner debuted \"Good Job\" Thursday during CNN's global town hall to address the latest questions and concerns in the fight against Covid-19. The tune was originally written months ago to honor the unsung heroes in Keys' own life, she told CNN in a conversation before the broadcast. \"It has always been such a personal song and such a poignant song,\" she said. \"And every time I play it, I want to cry because I'm thinking of my mother, I'm thinking of my grandmother, I'm thinking of friends of mine who can't make ends meet.\" But as the pandemic swept the world, it occurred to Keys that the lyrics could also serve as a tribute to the health care professionals, frontline workers, parents, teachers and everyone else who has stepped up during this unprecedented time. \"A lot of times people don't feel like they're doing a good job. They feel underwater and like there's never going to be a brighter day,\" she said. \"Fast forward to now, with where we are now, and it's almost like the song was written for this and I didn't know it.\" Keys has partnered with CNN to use the song as the theme for a new CNN Heroes campaign in celebration of the ordinary people who've emerged as heroes during the Covid-19 crisis.  Beginning Friday, viewers and visitors to CNN platforms will be invited to share pictures and videos of individuals from their communities who are doing their part to make the world a better, safer and healthier place.  CNN will recognize a collection of these everyday heroes each week.   \"Alicia Keys and the lyrics of 'Good Job' are sending a much needed message of gratitude to the frontline and essential workers of this crisis,\" said Whit Friese, CNN Vice President and Group Creative Cirector of Creative Marketing. \"It's been nothing short of an honor for our team to collaborate with such an incredible talent on a project as meaningful as this.\" The singer-songwriter recalled saying a prayer when she was nominated for her first Grammy Awards for her 2001 debut album, \"Songs in A Minor.\" \"Please let me have something to say,\" she prayed. \"Don't let me just have this moment and not have anything to say that's going to resonate with anybody.\" That same prayer is one of the reasons Keys said she was moved to write \"More Myself: A Journey,\" a New York Times bestseller and the first book on Oprah Winfrey's new imprint on Flatiron books. Keys said she and her family, which includes her husband producer Swizz Beatz, their two sons together and his son from a previous relationship -- have been using this time to reflect. \"We are definitely doing well, but we are continuously thinking about where are we going as a world and as a global family,\" Keys said. \"I think we have the opportunity to really think about who do we want to be first as individuals, then who do we want to be as communities and on a global level? That's a powerful thought and it feels like that's the mandate right now.\"",

And it all started after a trip to the grocery store. \"I wanted to create conversations ... that unite us all and humanize a lot of the conversations that we're seeing in the news,\" Valderrama told CNN in a recent interview. \"I was inspired by that after going to the grocery store and seeing a lot of our grocery store workers feeling kind of down and deflated and as I asked questions I started realizing they were getting kind of a beating from a lot of frustrated customers.\" Related: Swizz Beatz and Timbaland want to keep us entertained and in the light amid coronavirus Valderrama's series kicked off Wednesday with an interview with a farmer, he plans to next highlight grocery store employees and truck drivers.  \"I'm going to try to create an ecosystem of conversation so hopefully it creates perspective for not just my supporters but people out there,\" he continued. \"Hopefully we can lead with kindness and be a little more conscious and aware and thoughtful.\" He also started a hashtag of the same name, which went viral. \"I started really thinking maybe it's perspective,\" he said. \"Maybe we should think of it from a different angle. Maybe 6 feet apart means when we're too close to something we can't see things for what they can be. And if we're taking 6 feet maybe we can have a birds eye view ... of what things can actually be.\" Valderrama, 40, can also relate to the pain that so many are going through.  \"I've lost people to coronavirus,\" he said. \"My sister's jobs have stopped. I myself was sent home from work as well. I can relate on multiple levels.\" Valderrama has spent a great deal of his career bringing levity into the lives of his fans and he wants to offer a bit of advice. \"First and foremost if you woke up this morning you're already winning,\" he said. \"I would encourage people to do a list. Do an inventory of the things that you do have and find comfort that those are there for you ... Then make a second list of the things you don't want to live with. I promise you that when you acknowledge that list out loud and you can visually see it, those things stop existing and the other ones really take over. I feel like that creates a better harmony at home.\" ",

    "title": "Meghan McCain: No surprise on her pick for President - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) According to Meghan McCain, \"it shouldn't take a rocket scientist\" to know who she is voting for in the next presidential election. \"There's one man who has made pain in my life a living hell and another man who has literally shepherded me through the grief process,\" McCain said  Wednesday night during \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee, and McCain has said in the past that  she talks to him \"all the time.\"  Biden was a close friend of McCain's late father, Republican Sen. John McCain, and  publicly consoled his daughter on her show \"The View\" back in 2017 when the elder McCain was battling cancer.  In contrast, Meghan McCain and her family have had a contentious relationship with President Donald Trump, who is a Republican like her dad was. So it made sense that Cohen would ask McCain who she planned to vote for during her appearance on his late night show. But fellow guest on the show, \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" cast member Erika Jayne, took it even further, suggesting that McCain could become Biden's running mate. \"He said he was going to pick a woman,\" Jayne said. \"It should be you!\" McCain countered that she didn't know who Biden would select, noting that it could be California Sen. Kamala Harris. \"I'm not friends with Kamala,\" Jayne joked. McCain, who is pregnant , said she loves Biden \"dearly,\" but, \"I'm always like, my heart over my head in so many different ways.\"  \"The Trumps, they're always making my mom cry,\" McCain said. \"I just think politics is personal too and character is really important. And [I want] someone who's going to tamp down... fear and anger, instead of making it worse.\" ",

    "text": " (CNN) Tom Selleck was one of the hottest stars of the 1980s when he suddenly quit his hit show, \"Magnum P.I.\" The fame  got to be a bit much , he recalled recently. \"I quit 'Magnum,' not because I didn't like it or I was tired of it,\" Selleck  told People magazine.  \"I was tired from it. And I wanted a three-dimensional life because I didn't have one.\" The 75-year-old actor has opened up in a rare interview about  life on his Ventura, California, ranch  and the rigors of being a celebrity. Selleck first rose to fame on the crime drama, which ran on CBS from 1980 to 1988. A self-professed \"fairly private person,\" Selleck wasn't a huge fan of the Hollywood lifestyle.  \"I knew intellectually what it would mean in terms of being a public person, but until you've lived it, there's no way to understand it,\" he told People. \"I had a feeling of, 'I don't think I'm cut out for this.'\" Rather it's his family that Selleck treasures: his wife of 33 years, Jillie; their 31-year-old daughter Hannah; and Kevin, his 54-year-old son with first wife Jacqueline Ray. \"My relationships and my ranch keep me sane,\" Selleck said. Not that he's done in the industry. Selleck stars in another CBS drama, \"Blue Bloods,\" which is now in its 10th season. \"I'm proud of my work, I still love what I do, and I have my family,\" Selleck said. \"I've been enormously fortunate.\"",

    "title": "5 Games to Play on Video Chat During Coronavirus Quarantine - The New York Times",
    "text": "Social connection right now can come with a bit of a learning curve. While we can still see one another virtually, stressful times during the pandemic and a new digital dynamic can make it hard to replicate the lighthearted moments of bonding that we crave. Thankfully, it\u2019s still possible to enjoy many of the  benefits of social interaction  even when you\u2019re holed up at home \u2014 and playing games is a great way to do it in a group. \u201cWhen you are in a more positive place through games and laughter and connection, you see things from a broader perspective,\u201d said Dr. Emma Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, a Yale psychologist and author of \u201cThe Happiness Track.\u201d That\u2019s especially important because, while it might feel as if we\u2019re interacting with others, ruminating over headlines on social media heightens our anxiety and sense of isolation. Social connection is \u201cthe greatest human need after food and shelter,\u201d Dr. Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 said. It \u201cpredicts psychological health, physical health, recovery from disease, and longevity \u2014 it has a huge impact on our well-being.\u201d The opposite is true of isolation, which negatively impacts those aspects of our lives and can be a predictor of things like depression and anxiety. The good news is that since social connection is subjective, it \u201chas nothing to do with how many friends you have or how much contact you have with people,\u201d Dr. Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 said. All that matters is your perception, which you can shape by engaging in uplifting activities that help you feel closer to others. Here are a few ideas to get you and your friends laughing, chatting and, just for a moment, forgetting why you all can\u2019t be in the same room. (Maybe.) If you\u2019re a person who loves any excuse to talk about your niche interests, or you\u2019ve ever zealously tried to persuade your friends about something seemingly silly, Drink Talk Learn parties are the perfect way to let your elevator pitch shine and to learn more about your friend\u2019s eccentricities. It\u2019s simple: Each person puts together a presentation about something they\u2019re passionate about, and then everyone takes turns screen-sharing and talking for three minutes on their topic. It could be why Ringo was, in fact, the dreamiest Beatle; an impassioned argument about the correct way to hang a toilet paper roll; or an explainer on influencer drama \u2014 the more off-the-wall the topic is, the better. Once each person has presented, the group can vote on a winner or hand out awards in different categories, like best use of a GIF or most convincing argument. For smaller groups, consider giving everyone an extra minute or two to present. [Like what you\u2019re reading?  Sign up here  for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.] Scrambling and scavenging with friends is easily adaptable and enjoyably hectic, depending on the time limit you choose for each round. It\u2019s also a great way to explore your space, and see your stuff, in a new way. To play, you can choose to compete in themed rounds where players race to collect multiple items (imagine a craft round where players scramble to find yarn as well as objects made with hot glue). Or you can go by item by item, which has the benefit of permitting speed rounds during which only the fastest player scores. Players can also win multiple points depending on the prompt, like if they\u2019re challenged to find foreign currency and pull out cash from various countries. You can also up the ante by asking for multiples of popular household items \u2014 sure, everyone can probably find a penny, but can they find 17? How about a round where each additional type of battery earns you a point? With just a bit of creativity, finding everyday items can be transformed into an entertaining challenge.  Here\u2019s a list of items to get you started . If you enjoy a bit of honest misdirection and like to keep your friends guessing, this is for you. Perfect for people with a flair for drama, this game is another great way to learn a bit more about each player, whether you discover that they\u2019re a master of deception or that they happen to own a secret snow globe collection. To play, each person takes a turn picking an object in their house and telling the story of how they got it, without actually saying what it is. The rest of the group then has to guess, as quickly as they can, what that object is. Depending on how challenging you want the game to be, you can keep it light by only recounting the origin stories of items most people probably have in their home, or you can lift the restriction and let players pick from any of their possessions. While you aren\u2019t allowed to outright lie, the more dramatic, vague or misleading the storytelling, the better the game. If you\u2019re stumped on what to say, you can also get creative: For a secondhand sweater, a friend once described what she imagined its former owner was like and the places they might have taken it. Charades is perhaps the ultimate go-to game, but it doesn\u2019t always translate well to video chat, where lag time and people talking over each other can make for confusing gameplay. Luckily, drawing variations of charades are easy to play virtually and offer the same thrill of competitive urgency and bizarre prompt interpretations. To play, you can try the video chat platform  Houseparty , which offers a Pictionary-like game called Quick Draw, during which one person draws a series of prompts in a given amount of time, and everyone else has to guess the word. If your group prefers a different approach, you can easily do it D.I.Y. style, using a game word generator and having players take turns sharing their screens. For larger and more competitive groups, you can even split into two teams. To try another D.I.Y. drawing game, use a game word generator and have the main player describe what the thing looks like, with everyone else doing their best to draw it. The catch is that the main player can describe the object using only geometric shapes and the position of those shapes in relation to one another. As players do their best to follow these abstract drawing directions, they have to try to figure out what object is being described, with the person who guesses correctly winning the round. After everyone shows off their abstract interpretations, you can also decide to award extra points to the best Cubist artwork. With so much extra time at home, many of us are faced with the same opportunity: torture ourselves with an overly ambitious project, or give ourselves mental space to deal with what\u2019s going on (and perhaps pick up a few useless but entertaining party tricks along the way). And what to do with your new talents, gained courtesy of YouTube tutorials? Host a virtual talent show. There are countless ways you can dazzle your friends from a distance, like showing off your dance moves or making your juggling debut. Beyond actual talent, it\u2019s also good to reward originality \u2014 demonstrating how quickly (and semi-expertly) you can ice a cake or how speedily you can apply a cat-eye. If you\u2019re truly stumped about what to show off, everyone could benefit from having  a few magic tricks up their sleeve . In the spirit of trying something new, the group can also decide to limit talent displays to things people have learned recently, so that your friend with the voice of an angel will have to join the rest of the group in learning impressive feats, like how to balance a spoon on your chin. The more ridiculous and strange the talents, drawings or descriptions you come up with, the more fun you\u2019ll have. Because more than taking home the imaginary crown, the most important goal of these games \u2014 doing something fun and doing it together \u2014 makes everyone a winner.",

    "title": "Throwing Stick Hints at Ancient Ancestors' Hunting Techniques - The New York Times",
    "text": "What\u2019s so special about a 300,000-year-old stick stuck in the muck? \u201cIt\u2019s a stick, sure,\u201d said  Jordi Serangeli, an archaeologist  from the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. But to dismiss it as such, he added, would be like calling Neil Armstrong\u2019s first step on the moon \u201conly dirt with a print.\u201d That\u2019s because the short, pointed piece of wood his team found in Sch\u00f6ningen, Germany, in 2016 may be the newest addition to the hunting arsenal used by extinct human ancestors during the Middle Pleistocene. It was probably a throwing stick that was hurled like a non-returning boomerang, spinning through the air before striking birds, rabbits or other prey. Along with thrusting spears and javelins, it is the third class of wooden weapon discovered at the waterlogged site, occupied by either Neanderthals or  their, and supposedly our, heavy-browed ancestors, Homo heidelbergensis . When, in 1995, the Sch\u00f6ningen spears were  discovered  they  pierced the  debate over whether our early human relatives in Europe were simple scavengers incapable of crafting hunting tools. The throwing stick discovery adds to evidence that early hominins in our lineage were intelligent enough to prepare weapons and communicate together to topple prey. The paper was published Monday in  Nature Ecology & Evolution . \u201cWe can show that already 300,000 years ago, not only are these late Homo heidelbergensis or very early Neanderthals at the top of the food chain,\u201d said  Nicholas Conard, an archaeologist  at the university, \u201cbut they also have a whole range of important technological skills they can use to make sure they can feed themselves and lead their lives.\u201d Sch\u00f6ningen, which was once a lake shore, is known for its pristine preservation of organic material. The muddy sediment has defended wet artifacts from decay.  Excavations  have uncovered  bone tools ,  slaughtered horses  and  saber-toothed cat teeth . Their colleague, Martin Kursch, an excavator at the site, found the stick, which was about half the size of a pool cue and weighed about half a pound. It differed from thrusting spears and javelins because it was much shorter, and slightly curved. Dr. Conard noticed the wood piece resembled a short stick found in 1994 by Hartmut Thieme, the archaeologist who showcased the Sch\u00f6ningen spears. Dr. Thieme had called his find a \u201cthrowing stick\u201d but lacked evidence to support his claim. Other researchers interpreted it as a child\u2019s spear, a root digger or a bark peeler. \u201cI remember picking it up, and I was afraid it would just fall apart, it was kind of terrifying,\u201d Dr. Conard said. \u201cBut in fact it wasn\u2019t like that at all. To the touch it was solid.\u201d They placed the stick in a cool, dark water bath to keep it moist and protected from microbes.  Gerlinde Bigga, an archaeobotanist  at the university, analyzed its cell structure and found it was carved from a solid piece of spruce. \u201cYou could harm some animals with that,\u201d Dr. Bigga said. Next,  Veerle Rots, a paleoarchaeologist  at the University of Lie\u0300ge in Belgium, examined it to determine its purpose. \u201cIf you look at the piece you could perhaps think it\u2019s a mini spear, but that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Dr. Rots. \u201cThrowing sticks are pointed at both ends, but that\u2019s actually for the flight trajectory, it\u2019s not for piercing.\u201d Similar features are seen in certain  Aboriginal Tasmanian throwing sticks . Dr. Rots found a large gash near the stick\u2019s center, which suggested it had struck something. \u201cIt was very exciting for me to see there was impact evidence, and I could make a case that it was a throwing stick,\u201d she said. Annemieke Milks, a paleoarchaeologist  from the University College London, who was not involved with the study, said the finding \u201chelps us to build a picture of the diversity of hunting technologies available to Eurasian Middle Pleistocene hominins.\u201d But  Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser, a paleoarchaeologist  at Germany\u2019s R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, was not convinced. Had the wooden tool been a throwing stick, she would have expected to see significant scars on its tips rather than near its center. Dr. Rots disagreed, saying any part of the flying stick could have struck a target. Her team plans to perform ballistic testing with a wooden recreation to demonstrate that the throwing stick was a dangerous weapon for early hominin hunters.",

    "title": "Ricky Gervais on \u2018After Life\u2019 and Life After the Golden Globes - The New York Times",
    "text": "Ricky Gervais  generally has reliable comic timing. He helped usher in a renaissance of documentary-style cringe comedy as a creator and star of  the original British version of \u201cThe Office.\u201d  And he has successfully positioned himself against the well-heeled Hollywood crowd that occasionally invites Gervais to mock them to their faces  as host of the Golden Globes . (In his routine in January, Gervais roasted his celebrity peers for their displays of social consciousness while they worked for corporations like Amazon, Apple \u2014 \u201ca company that runs sweatshops in China\u201d \u2014 and Disney. \u201cIf ISIS started a streaming service you\u2019d call your agent, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he taunted.) But will the current cultural moment be as receptive to Season 2 of Gervais\u2019s dark comedy series  \u201cAfter Life\u201d  when  Netflix  releases it on Friday? On this show, which Gervais created, writes and directs, he also plays the lead role of Tony Johnson, a widower still mourning his wife, Lisa (Kerry Godliman), who died of breast cancer. In his grief, Tony resolves to become the person he\u2019s always wanted to be \u2014 self-assertive, impolitic and largely resistant to the efforts of friends who hope to steer him onto more positive paths. \u201cAfter Life\u201d is suffused with an existentialism that could make it either an ideal tonic right now or too uncomfortably real \u2014 and Gervais knows that its tone is tricky even under normal circumstances. As he said in a recent video chat from his home in north London: \u201cThe big worry for me was, could people go from laughing about something ridiculous to crying about something very real? I think the answer is yes.\u201d Gervais talked about making comedy out of misery, the response to his Golden Globes set and his wariness of celebrity worship. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How is your quarantine going? We\u2019re in one of the better places called the Vale of Health. I think that\u2019s a good omen. We\u2019re on lockdown but you\u2019re allowed to exercise every day. I\u2019ve turned into that guy \u2014 when I see people having picnics and stuff like that, I want to call the police: \u201cThere\u2019s some ne\u2019er-do-wells having fun and games!\u201d Are things really all that different for you? Apart from the gigs that were postponed, my life hasn\u2019t changed much. I didn\u2019t go out a lot, and there\u2019s always enough booze in the house for a nuclear winter. You won\u2019t hear me complain. Not when, every day, I see some millionaire celebrity going, \u201cI\u2019m sad that I\u2019m not on telly tonight.\u201d Or, \u201cI had a swim in the pool that made me feel a little bit better.\u201d [Begins to sing.]  \u201cImagine there\u2019s no heaven \u2014 \u201d Your comedy is often critical of fame and the people who covet it. Do you think that the pandemic has accelerated our distaste for celebrity culture? I\u2019ve got nothing against anyone being a celebrity or being famous. I think that people are just a bit tired of being lectured to. Now celebrities think: \u201cThe general public needs to see my face. They can\u2019t get to the cinema \u2014 I need to do something.\u201d And it\u2019s when you look into their eyes, you know that, even if they\u2019re doing something good, they\u2019re sort of thinking, \u201cI could weep at what a good person I am.\u201d Oh dear. But when you perform a stand-up routine like the one you did at this year\u2019s Golden Globes, you don\u2019t have to look over your shoulder when the night is over? No, the world hasn\u2019t changed. No one looks at me differently. And I\u2019ve got nothing against those people, really. I think that\u2019s the mistake people make: They think that every joke is a window to the comedian\u2019s soul \u2014 because I wrote it and performed it under my own name, that that\u2019s really me. And that\u2019s just not true. I\u2019ll flip a joke halfway through and change my stance to make the joke better. I\u2019ll pretend to be right wing, left wing, whatever wing, no wing. I\u2019ve got to go after the richest people in the room, and NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press [Association, which organizes the Golden Globes]. I\u2019ve got to be a court jester, but a court jester\u2019s got to make sure that he doesn\u2019t get executed as well. I\u2019ve got to make all the peasants laugh at the king, but the king\u2019s sort of got to like it. [Laughs.] A lot of political conservatives became fans of yours after that performance because they felt you\u2019d finally stuck it to the Hollywood elite. Do you think any were driven away after they learned you didn\u2019t share their viewpoints on other issues? I didn\u2019t notice that on Twitter until a couple of disgruntled liberal elites suddenly said, \u201cOh, Gervais is alt-right now.\u201d And I went, what? What\u2019s right-wing about taking the mickey out of the richest, most powerful corporations on the planet? But I\u2019ve had this before. People that followed me, if they were far right, they\u2019re probably not atheists like me. They probably don\u2019t like some of the language that I use. They probably don\u2019t agree with my anti-trophy hunting stance. In general, I think most normal people follow a person for a particular reason or two. If the tweets I hate outnumber the ones I like, I\u2019ll unfollow him. No one has to be perfect to have friends. They just have to be, on balance, OK. The themes of death and how we deal with loss are pervasive in \u201cAfter Life.\u201d Does that make it any more attuned to the current moment? Or does that make it harder to watch? I think we second-guess people too much. We worry about what the people at home can take. Real life\u2019s worse. They can take all of this. It stuns me that people still think, \u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t joke about that.\u201d We\u2019re reading about it in the paper \u2014 why can\u2019t we joke about it? With other shows of mine, people come up to me on the street, and they usually say, \u201cI love the show\u201d But with this one \u2014 and this was before coronavirus \u2014 they come up to me and say, \u201cI just want to say, I lost my sister three weeks ago.\u201d Or, \u201cI lost my husband.\u201d No one said, \u201cOh, I had to turn it off because it was too upsetting,\u201d or, \u201cIt reminded me of something bad.\u201d You suddenly realize, of course \u2014 everyone\u2019s grieving. And the older you get, the more you\u2019ve got to grieve. There\u2019s a scene in one of the new episodes when Tony tells another character: \u201cEverything\u2019s bad for you. We\u2019re all dying. Being healthy is just dying more slowly.\u201d Do you think about moments like that one differently now? I think it would be different if I did a show that was specifically about coronavirus \u2014 [wearily] which there are going to be hundreds. And novels. And weird, fake reality shows. But in the abstract, it\u2019s a joke about death, and people are dying all the time. People aren\u2019t going, \u201cNo one was dying until this year \u2014 that joke didn\u2019t age well.\u201d Tony\u2019s acting nihilistically. He\u2019s reminding people that he\u2019s not over it. He still wants to punish the world. There\u2019s a narcissism to his grieving, in a way. And then he confronts people that are worse off than him and make him feel slightly spoiled. We all go through that. What gets us out of our nihilism and gets us over attitudes like that? One of the ideas in \u201cAfter Life\u201d is about how the mundane saves us. We need those little things. The fact that the dog, literally and metaphorically, saves Tony\u2019s life, over and over again. I say to the dog, \u201cIf you could open a can, I\u2019d be dead now.\u201d Death is the last taboo. It\u2019s imminent. It\u2019s going to happen. We just don\u2019t want it to be now, whenever it is. But we can still joke about it. I don\u2019t know if that makes the show any more or less poignant or entertaining than any other time. But people do all the things they\u2019re supposed to now: They stay in. They wash their hands. They phone their family. And then, I think, they want to watch \u201c Tiger King .\u201d You know? No one\u2019s thinking about coronavirus when they\u2019re watching. And life goes on. Life\u2019s got to go on. Life goes on.",

    "title": "Did Heavy Rain Make Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea Volcano Erupt? - The New York Times",
    "text": "The monthslong eruption of Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano in the spring and summer of 2018 was the  most destructive of its recorded history . As the summit crater periodically collapsed, 320,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u2019 worth of lava was squeezed out of fissures on its eastern flank. Flaming rivers of molten rock destroyed 700 homes while building new volcanic shorelines, vaporizing lakes and conjuring bizarre weather. What kick-started such a dramatic sequence? A study published Wednesday in  Nature  suggests an unusual suspect: rainfall. In the months before the eruption, Hawaii was inundated by above-average precipitation. This rainfall would have found its way into the pores present within Kilauea\u2019s volcanic rocks. If too much water tries to cram into these pores, the rock fragments from the inside out. This new model suggests that, just before the outburst of lava in May 2018, the rocks surrounding the volcano\u2019s cache of magma were experiencing a 47-year peak in pore pressure \u2014 enough to break down the walls holding its magma in place until the liquefied rock made a break for it. The study\u2019s authors,  Jamie Farquharson  and  Falk Amelung , both earth scientists at the University of Miami, note that 60 percent of the volcano\u2019s eruptions since 1790 have occurred during the area\u2019s shorter rainy season rather than its dry season. That makes them suspect that rainfall has played a key role in triggering not just the 2018 eruption, but also many throughout its history. It\u2019s a bold claim. \u201cApproaching any new theory with a healthy dose of skepticism is important,\u201d said Dr. Farquharson. But many other scientists aren\u2019t buying it. There are known cases where environmental changes around a volcano affect its eruptive activity. Evidence suggests that big earthquakes, for example, can  trigger eruptions  but perhaps only if the volcano is  primed to erupt . There is also  tentative evidence  that rainfall could trigger small earthquakes along some faults. And the notion that water accumulating in rock cavities can destructively forge new corridors for magma isn\u2019t unreasonable either, said  Michael Manga , a geoscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study but wrote a perspective piece accompanying the paper. That\u2019s the basic principle of  hydraulic fracturing , where pressurized fluids are injected underground to break rocks open and liberate their fossil fuel contents. But this process simply isn\u2019t needed to explain why Kilauea went haywire in 2018, said  Michael Poland , the scientist-in-charge at the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. In the weeks before the appearance of those lava-effusing fissures on its eastern flanks, the volcano had been inflating. The lava lake at the summit crater  had also overflowed . Both indicated that the magma cache was accumulating pressure. It was fairly clear why: the lava flow out of Kilauea\u2019s Pu\u2018u \u2018O\u2018o crater had diminished, while the flow of magma into the entire volcano continued. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a kink in the hose,\u201d Dr. Poland said. \u201cEventually, the plumbing system just backed up.\u201d And throughout, those monitoring the volcano saw no changes explained by rainfall. It did rain a lot before the volcano\u2019s outburst in May. But Kilauea has been erupting for 35 years and experienced plenty of heavy, prolonged rain storms during that time, said  Janine Krippner , a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Global Volcanism Program. But nothing like the 2018 inferno \u2014 the final, furious flourish of that prolonged period of eruptive activity \u2014 took place during other wet occasions. And although this rainfall would have certainly percolated underground, the study\u2019s model is too simplistic to assume it made its way down to the magma\u2019s depth. The subsurface of Kilauea is a byzantine collection of rocky features, including many impermeable walls of frozen magma. Much of the water there doesn\u2019t move downward, but sideways. \u201cThe hydrology of Kilauea is incredibly complex,\u201d Dr. Poland said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be well approximated by simple models.\u201d If the rainwater did fracture layers of rock, starting at the surface and reaching rocks near the magma, this should have produced a downwardly propagating wave of seismicity. This pattern was not seen, said Dr. Manga. Even if the water did find its way to the depth of the magma cache, the peak stresses in the study\u2019s model are too small to make a difference, even to a volcano ready to erupt. Such stresses are weaker than those caused by the gravitational pull of the moon. \u201cIf rainfall is going to trigger a change in behavior, why don\u2019t the tides?\u201d Dr. Manga said. The study also contradicts a historical record of hundreds of volcanoes around the world that have been saturated by rain throughout recorded history. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any convincing evidence for rainfall being a trigger for an eruption,\u201d said Dr. Krippner. The study\u2019s authors are aware that their model simplifies the deep architecture of Kilauea, as is the case for any model trying to virtually reconstruct a complex volcanic system. Dr. Farquharson said they were nevertheless \u201cconfident that it is able to reproduce the subsurface movement of water in the rift zone reasonably well.\u201d But as sensors were not tracking fluid pressures at depth during the 2018 eruption, this model\u2019s results are difficult to validate. This eruption \u2014 from its dramatic paroxysm in May 2018 to its abrupt decline that August \u2014 \u201chighlights how difficult eruption forecasting is,\u201d Dr. Manga said. Volcanoes are not stand-alone sentinels but components of a complex Earth system, he says, and investigating the forces that could be influencing them is a worthwhile endeavor.",

On a special episode of \u201cThe Argument,\u201d Frank Bruni talks one-on-one with  Ginia Bellafante , who writes The Times\u2019s  Big City  column. They discuss how New York has weathered past catastrophes, like Sept. 11 and Hurricane Sandy, and how dealing with the virus both echoes and exceeds those challenges. And they forecast how the current crisis could either worsen or abate some of the city\u2019s uglier features, from a class divide and gentrification to sky-high housing prices. Plus, some nostalgia for restaurants and a reading recommendation from Ginia \u201cabout the reverberations of death and crisis.\u201d Background Reading: Frank on  why the coronavirus is worse than Sept. 11 , and  the pandemic\u2019s class divide Ginia on  the life and death of Joe Joyce ,  the vulnerable low-paid workers on the front lines of the pandemic  and  the rich people fleeing New York I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times\u2019s Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church, George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process and meatloaf. Politically, I\u2019m grief-stricken over the way President Trump has governed and I\u2019m left of center, but I don\u2019t think that the center is a bad place or compromise a dirty word. I\u2019m Italian-American, I\u2019m gay and I write a  weekly Times newsletter  in which you\u2019ll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of our Manhattan apartment. I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife. I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.

    "title": "How to Handwash Your Clothes - The New York Times",
    "text": "Laundromats have been deemed  essential businesses  in cities and states that have issued stay-at-home orders to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. But many laundry business owners have chosen to close for the safety of their employees, leaving those who rely on laundromats without access to washing machines and dryers. Even if your local laundromat is still operating, you may choose to wash clothes at home to avoid being exposed to other people. Here\u2019s how to do it. Prepare your station First, you\u2019ll need to determine where this operation will take place: Washing clothes by hand requires a clean space roomy enough to fully submerge your garments in water. For most people, the kitchen sink will be the best place for hand laundering, but a utility sink, a roomy bathroom sink, the bathtub or a washing basin are also options. Clean the sink with an all-purpose cleaner and fill it with water, leaving enough room for your clothes and hands to move around inside. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s  current recommendations regarding laundry and coronavirus  are to use the hottest water temperature a garment can tolerate. (Check the label.) And you can wear gloves if it\u2019s more comfortable. suds Add 1 teaspoon of regular liquid or powder detergent for each pound of clothing you wash. (Neil Lant, a research fellow at Procter & Gamble who is focused on fabric care, said that on average three items of adult-sized clothing weigh about a pound.) Be careful not to use too much detergent, as it will make the rinsing process exceedingly long and is likely to leave behind residue that can cause skin irritation. A no-rinse detergent like  Soak Wash  is a great option because it removes a step from the process. You should never puncture a detergent pack for hand laundering; the detergent that is sold in packs is highly concentrated, and it poses a risk if it comes in contact with the eye, either from being squirted out of a pack or from the detergent being transferred from the hands to the eyes. While detergents designed specifically for hand laundering provide easy-to-follow dosage guidelines, it can be trickier to determine how much regular laundry detergent to use. Swirl Add clothes to the detergent solution and submerge them fully. Use your hands to mimic the agitation of a washing machine. Move the garments by swirling and pumping them in the detergent solution so that it can penetrate the fibers. Soak Once the garments are submerged, allow them to soak in the solution for 15 to 60 minutes, depending on how visibly dirty the fabric is. DRAIN AND RINSE Drain the detergent solution and wipe the sink free of any suds, then refill the sink with clean cool or lukewarm water to begin rinsing. Using your hands, agitate the clothes to release detergent, draining the water and repeating until they are fully rinsed. Sturdier fibers like polyester and cotton can be rinsed directly under running water, though you should avoid rinsing delicate items like hosiery or fine scarves directly under a running tap. Dry After the final rinse, drain the sink, move the clothing to one side and, one by one, press down on each garment to extrude the water held in its fibers. Do not wring the fibers, which can cause stretching or other damage. The first press, so to speak (it\u2019s like making wine!), is just with hands, in the sink, to push out as much water as possible without wringing. If you have a clean, dry towel to spare, lay the clothing flat on the towel and roll the towel and piece of clothing up together, jelly roll style. The combination of pressing out the water and rolling the item in a dry towel will leave it only damp, rather than dripping wet, which will speed up drying time. If you don\u2019t have a clean towel to spare, but you do have a salad spinner, it can be used to extrude water from smaller items like socks, underwear or T-shirts. Allow the clothing to air dry by laying it flat, using a drying rack or line drying it if that is an option. As far as outdoor drying goes, the same rules apply as for exposure to people, said Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. If the clothes are more than 6 feet away from an infected person\u2019s sneezing or coughing droplets, they are safe to line dry. \u201cIt is unlikely coronavirus is floating through the air outside,\u201d said Dr. Menachery. \u201cNow if your neighbor is sick and coughs out the window less than 6 feet away from you hanging clothes, then they might be contaminated.\u201d Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, echoed that opinion in an email: \u201cThe coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is not airborne. It is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces.\u201d If you do not have a drying rack or if space in your home is limited, wet clothes can be put on plastic hangers and hung from a shower curtain rod to drip-dry. Check the weather and, if you have outdoor space, do your wash on a dry day. Even if you will be drying clothes indoors, lower air-moisture levels will help your items dry faster. Working in small batches \u2014 3 to 4 days worth of clothes \u2014 will make the process much easier, and will not leave every surface of your home covered in drip-drying pieces. Bulky items like towels and sheets can be difficult to wash and even more difficult to dry, especially for those without access to outdoor space for line dying. Instead of washing them,  spot treat any stains  and then steam them, which will freshen and clean them. You can also extend bed linen use by laundering pillowcases only, which are smaller and less cumbersome to wash and dry by hand.",

    "title": "How Bird-Watching Prepared Me for Sheltering in Place - The New York Times",
    "text": "Chimney Rock, on the eastern spur of the Point Reyes headlands in California, is well known for the elephant seals that congregate there. One afternoon, while walking down the path overlooking them, I saw a woman looking through a spotting scope on a tripod, directed out toward the water. It turned out she was watching seabirds. She told me she started bird-watching as she got older because she was analytically minded, loved numbers and words, but struggled with visual memory and acuity and wanted to strengthen those faculties. Having similar proclivities, I listened closely. Eventually, she asked me if I wanted to look. Birds were the last thing on my mind that day. Like any vulgar American, I had been socialized to value the blockbuster, the high status: the elephant seals, the humpback whales spouting just offshore. But when she showed me this modest and compelling bird \u2014 one I\u2019d seen many times before, with whitish-gray plumage and a black-capped head, now completely close up \u2014 I began to see things differently. According to the National Park Service, there have been reports of nearly 500 different bird species at Point Reyes, making it the place of \u201cgreatest avian diversity in any U.S. national park.\u201d But birds are everywhere, and every day since I met my unwitting bird-watching mentor, I\u2019ve been looking for them. There aren\u2019t any shortcuts to honing one\u2019s skills \u2014 it\u2019s just about having a good field guide, a good set of binoculars and patience. Sometimes I have my binoculars in hand; other times I\u2019m casually watching, observing birds\u2019 size, shape, color and patterns as they hop along by the subway station, twitter away under an awning or pick through the trash on the street. Watching birds is a rush, a challenge to slow down the present long enough to glimpse it in all its precise detail. Last year I took a trip alone, deep in the Oregon Cascades, hiking far into the forested mountains and looking for birds. Eventually I saw a golden eagle, its six-foot wingspan soaring right past me, but I spent most of my time chasing one of the few consistent breaks in the silence: the persistent calls of what I later found to be the dark-eyed junco, a common type of sparrow that\u2019s often slate-gray or brown, with a whitish belly. I found the whole situation endearing: I set out into the sublime terrain of Oregon mountain and forest, only to have my time there dominated by this small, common bird. Bird-watching is not always exhilarating \u2014 in fact, it can be largely mundane, a hobby of quiet precision and focus. Even common birds can sometimes be challenging to identify, especially for novices like me. (The sometimes subtle differences, for example, between female house sparrows and female house finches can still trip me up.) But the practice has sharpened my attention: Noticing compelling detail has become a feature of my daily life, even more so since I\u2019ve begun to shelter in place. When I look out my window now, I notice details I wouldn\u2019t have before, like how herculean people seem, with looks of fixed determination as they haul home way more groceries than they\u2019d normally carry, or how people walking their dogs will almost always slouch a little resignedly when they pause to let their dogs sniff around in something. Yesterday I was staring blankly out the window when I noticed the way the tops of the trees move in the wind looks almost as if they\u2019re silently gesturing to one another. Birds have taught me to love what is small, what is delicate, what is elusive. I\u2019ve learned that a truth is many details comprising what seems like a unified whole, and I\u2019m more inclined now to immerse myself in the details for their own sake. In looking at common birds in my neighborhood, there\u2019s a refreshing variety in their sameness, a consistent challenge to discern what seems too normal to even notice after so many times noticing. Spotting rare and beautiful birds is thrilling, much like seeing elephant seals or whales. Yet common birds and their details can feel hard to see, because they\u2019re everywhere. Seeking these birds compels you to plumb your memory, to refine the past, to sift small details in service of the present. And those details anchor you, precluding temptations toward self-absorption, self-importance. Bird-watching, in short, is about taking in the most in the shortest span of time. I remain sheltering in place, scared and saddened. Yet I\u2019ve also been noticing details in my apartment I wouldn\u2019t have noticed before, like the impressive range of noises a radiator can make, or how the dust on my bookshelves is the exact same color as the increasing number of gray hairs on my head. There\u2019s reassurance in noticing these things, a sense of fleeting stability \u2014 even if the radiator, the dust and the gray hairs may stay around longer than most birds would. Through birds, I\u2019ve learned to pay attention, and now, in isolation, to seek solace in the act of looking. I\u2019ve adapted my bird-watching practices too. I keep binoculars on the table of the front room of my third-floor apartment. Throughout my remote workday, I hear birds singing and calling, and I\u2019ll walk over to the windows to take a closer look. Recently, at dusk, a bird landed on a branch right outside one of the windows, peering in. It was hard to identify in the waning light, but it happened to just be a robin. Yet it stood there so still, so severe-seeming, with its chest puffed out. It looked like a guardian of something vital in the gathering dark.",

    "title": "Deirdre Bair, Beckett and de Beauvoir Biographer, Dies at 84 - The New York Times",
    "text": "Deirdre Bair, who as an unknown writer a half-century ago scored a coup by getting the reclusive Samuel Beckett to agree to let her write his biography, then secured the same permission from another towering literary figure, Simone de Beauvoir, died on Friday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 84. Her daughter, Katney Bair, said the cause was heart failure. Ms. Bair called herself \u201can accidental biographer, one who had never read a biography before she decided that Samuel Beckett needed one and she was the person to write it.\u201d She came to that decision serendipitously. Having received a fellowship to do graduate study at Columbia University, she needed a research subject. After making too-slow progress on a medieval-studies topic, she decided to turn to a 20th-century author instead. She wrote the names of some possibilities on index cards. \u201cWithout thinking about which name might present the best opportunity for original research,\u201d she said years later, \u201cor even which I liked the most, I shuffled them into alphabetical order. There were no A\u2019s, and Beckett came first, before Joseph Conrad and E.M. Forster. Beckett it shall be, I said to myself, and that was how my life in biography began.\u201d She dived into a study of his novels (\u201cMolloy,\u201d \u201cMalone Dies\u201d) and plays (\u201cWaiting for Godot,\u201d \u201cHappy Days\u201d). \u201cReading Beckett\u2019s work made me want answers to a lot of questions,\u201d she said, \u201call of which were based on the life from which the work sprang.\u201d Deciding to attempt a biography, she wrote to Beckett in Paris from her home in Connecticut in July 1971. \u201cThe mail between New Haven and Paris was probably never again as swift as it was during that exchange,\u201d she said. \u201cA week to the day after I mailed my letter, I received his reply.\u201d To her shock, Beckett was amenable. \u201cAny biographical information I possess is at your disposal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you come to Paris,\u201d he added, \u201cI will see you.\u201d Years of interviews and research followed before \u201cSamuel Beckett: A Biography\u201d appeared in 1978. The paperback release won a  National Book Award  in 1981. Her biography of Simone de Beauvoir (author of \u201cThe Second Sex,\u201d among other books) was also years in the making and written with its subject\u2019s cooperation. It was published in 1990. \u201cTo Ms. Bair\u2019s credit,\u201d Herbert Mitgang  wrote in a review  in The New York Times, \u201cher book isn\u2019t just a love letter but a fair-minded and often skeptical appraisal of de Beauvoir\u2019s life. At the end, I found myself respecting but not always liking de Beauvoir and her circle because of the heavy cloak of arrogance they wove around themselves.\u201d The Times Book Review named it one of the best books of the year. Ms. Bair later wrote biographies of the writer Ana\u00efs Nin (1995), the psychiatrist Carl Jung (2003), the illustrator Saul Steinberg (2012) and the gangster Al Capone (2016), but her first two books remained her calling cards. People asked her about Beckett and de Beauvoir so often that she wrote a book about her experiences as their biographer:  \u201cParisian Lives: Samuel Beckett, Simone deBeauvoir, and Me,\u201d  published last year. \u201cThe original idea was to write something primarily for scholars and writers that would cover all my biographies,\u201d Ms. Bair wrote in that book, \u201cto concentrate on the decisions I made when dealing with structure and content, or how I worked in foreign archives and languages, or how I dealt with reluctant heirs and troublesome estates. Each time I suggested this possible project, even to fellow biographers or academics, the response was always, \u2018That\u2019s all very nice, but please just tell us what Beckett and de Beauvoir were really like.\u2019\u201d Deirdre Bartolotta was born on June 21, 1935, in Pittsburgh to Vincent and Helen (Kruki) Bartolotta. She grew up in nearby Monongahela. In  \u201cOne Extraordinary Street,\u201d  a documentary video about the unusual number of prominent people who grew up on or near Park Avenue there, she spoke of being an enthusiastic reader as a girl, so much so that by fifth grade she had become bored with books for young readers. She tried to check out adult fare from the local library, but the librarian would not let her, prompting her to complain to her father. \u201cHe went down to the library, and he said, \u2018You let my daughter read anything she wants,\u2019\u201d she said in the film. \u201cSo the next week I came home with \u2018Forever Amber,\u2019 which was that generation\u2019s dirty book.\u201d She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957 with a degree in English and set her sights on a career in journalism. While her husband, Lavon Bair, whom she had married during her senior year, was serving with the Sixth Fleet, she followed him around the globe and worked as a stringer for Newsweek. When they settled in New Haven, she was a reporter for The New Haven Register, raising their two young children and supporting her husband while he was in graduate school. In 1968 it was her turn to go to graduate school; she applied for a writing fellowship, but rather than take it at nearby Yale University, she chose an institution two hours away. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019d better go to Columbia, because what if I fail?\u2019\u201d she said in a recent  talk  at the Free Library of Philadelphia. \u201c\u2018I can always say commuting got to be too much for me.\u2019\u201d She did not fail; she earned a Ph.D. in comparative literature at Columbia in 1972. By then she had already had her first meeting with Beckett. His first words to her, she wrote in \u201cParisian Lives,\u201d were, \u201cSo you are the one who is going to reveal me for the charlatan that I am.\u201d They talked for two hours, the first of many interviews. Beckett, she wrote, told her near the end of that first session: \u201cI will neither help nor hinder you. My friends and family will assist you and my enemies will find you soon enough.\u201d In the 1980s she was back in Paris interviewing de Beauvoir, who, she said, could be mercurial, especially if Ms. Bair\u2019s questions ventured into areas that de Beauvoir didn\u2019t want scrutinized. Once, when they had been working together for three years, de Beauvoir abruptly stopped the interview and told her to leave. \u201cShe literally shoved me out the door of her apartment,\u201d Ms. Bair said in the Philadelphia talk. \u201cAnd then I thought: \u2018Well, now what do I do? I\u2019ve invested three years in this book.\u2019 Well, I simply went back for the next appointment that we had scheduled as if nothing had happened, and she treated me exactly as if nothing had happened. And that\u2019s how we worked.\u201d In addition to her other biographies, Ms. Bair wrote \u201cCalling It Quits: Late-Life Divorce and Starting Over\u201d (2007), examining the phenomenon of couples who divorced after decades of marriage. Although she did not dwell on it in the book, her own marriage had ended after 43 years. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Bair is survived by a son, Vonn Scott Bair; a sister, Linda Rankin; a brother, Vince Bartolotta; and a granddaughter. Ms. Bair told The Times Union of Albany in 1995 that the only response to her biography she received from Beckett,  who died in 1989 , was a brief note: \u201cDear Mrs. Bair: Seems a very handsome looking book.\u201d De Beauvoir  died in 1986 , before Ms. Bair\u2019s biography was published. In the book, the author recalled what turned out to be her final meeting with de Beauvoir. Their other sessions had always ended with a handshake. \u201cThis time,\u201d she wrote, \u201ctiny woman that she was, she reached up out and half embraced me, tall woman that I am, by placing her hands around my upper arms and giving me a brisk shake.\u201d",

    "title": "Few Travelers, Few Flights and Now, a Total Airport Shutdown - The New York Times",
    "text": "Before the coronavirus pandemic brought air travel to a near standstill, airlines operated 40 daily flights from Westchester County Airport. Soon, there will be none. The airport, which serves the suburbs just north of New York City, has found a slim silver lining in its largely vacant and eerily quiet terminal: It can close temporarily, with minimal disruption, to accelerate construction that had been planned for later in the year. George Latimer, the Westchester County executive, said the airport would shut down on Monday. According to industry experts, it would be the first commercial airport in the country to close its doors entirely. Four airlines \u2014 United, Delta, JetBlue and American \u2014 had been flying to 11 destinations from the Westchester airport, which is in White Plains and owned by the county. On a recent visit, only one flight was operating. A project to repave the airport\u2019s 6,500-foot runway that had been planned before the pandemic was supposed to take four months, with work taking place from midnight to 6 a.m. Once the airport closes on Monday, the work will be done during the day and is expected to take about a month. A shorter runway used by light aircraft is scheduled to be out of service for a week. Operators of business jets initially balked at the idea of the closing. Unlike at most major airports, flights by private aviation, including corporate and fractional operators like NetJets, far outnumber those of the airlines at Westchester. The closing means some airplane owners will have to move their aircraft to nearby airports if they want to keep flying. \u201cPeople were surprised because Westchester is one of the busier general aviation airports, especially with the corporate traffic,\u201d said Brett Smith, a private pilot who used to fly from Westchester and whose company owns the passenger terminal at a new airport in Seattle. The closing for the construction \u201cdoes make sense when you think about it. I thought it was pretty smart.\u201d Over the years, Westchester County Airport, which marked its 75th anniversary in February, has played bit roles in several Hollywood productions, including \u201cMeet the Parents\u201d and the television show \u201cBillions.\u201d It handled Air Force One when President Bill Clinton was in the White House and accommodated Hillary Clinton\u2019s flights home to Westchester when she was secretary of state. But the airport has, at times, had tense relationships with its neighbors. They have complained of noise from corporate jet operators, who account for 55 percent of the airport\u2019s traffic. On that point, the runway closing will offer temporary relief. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifting certainly of noise and air pollution from air travel, and that\u2019s good for public health and sanity,\u201d said George Klein, vice president of Sierra Club Lower Hudson Group. Still, he added, the short break would not provide any long-term benefit for the environment. With commercial airlines accounting for just 14 percent of the airport\u2019s operations, corporate jets, charter companies, flight schools and private aviation have made the airport New York State\u2019s third busiest. Closing the runway will mean the airport will lose nearly all of its revenue streams. Another regional airport, New York Stewart International Airport, located about 60 miles north of Manhattan, has a similar problem with airline service drying up, but is staying open. Stewart has experienced a boom in recent years with the number of passengers having doubled from 2016 to 2018. But 2019 was a bad year after Norwegian, Stewart\u2019s only international carrier, left the airport. When the coronavirus outbreak started sweeping the state, JetBlue and American canceled their Stewart flights for two months; Delta now offers just one flight a day. Allegiant, a low-cost carrier, has also canceled many of its flights. But unlike Westchester, the airport is compelled to stay open. UPS and FedEx use the airport to move domestic freight, and it is also a crucial hub for the United States Postal Service. DHL has a distribution facility there, and the 105th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard also operates from Stewart. The situation is much the same at other airports that have seen passengers disappear, but where cargo, corporate, military and other essential flights are still operating \u2014 in some cases as frequently as before the virus brought most other travel to a halt. With neither cargo nor military users, Westchester County Airport had less to consider before shutting down. Other airports across the country are also trying to make the most of a bad situation, said Christopher Oswald, the vice president of safety and regulatory affairs for the Airports Council International, a trade group. \u201cA number of airports are taking the opportunities that do exist to expedite work, replacing carpet with tile, taking a project delayed because of spring break travel and moving it forward to summer travel,\u201d Mr. Oswald said. Airport managers are also trying different approaches to generate revenue since it remains unclear when air travel might resume in significant numbers. One video that went viral showed acres of pavement at Pittsburgh International Airport being used to store nearly a hundred grounded American Airlines jets. Christina Cassotis, the chief executive of the Allegheny Airport Authority, said she came up with the idea to lease the space to the airline long before the coronavirus affected travel in the United States. \u201cWe saw in Asia and Europe how airlines would need places to park their fleets,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Cassotis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big airfield and American has a maintenance base here, and it makes sense for aircraft to park here.\u201d When it comes to major construction projects though, Ms. Cassotis has put the brakes on a $1.1 billion renovation plan given the uncertainty over what air travel might look like once the outbreak starts easing. It is an issue that many airport officials are likely going to wrestle with. \u201cWhere are the structural changes this industry is going to have to make for people to have restored confidence in it?\u201d Ms. Cassotis said. \u201cHow do we help facilitate confidence in travel again? What are the cleaning and social-distancing options for people to want to feel good about traveling again?\u201d When airline flights into Pittsburgh started dwindling, Ms. Cassotis said she could not consider closing the airport even temporarily because, like Stewart, her airport serves a thriving airfreight sector. FedEx and UPS moved nearly 16,000 metric tons of freight in the first quarter of 2020, slightly less than in 2019. The military also uses the airport, with the Air Force Reserve 911th Airlift Wing providing coronavirus-relief flights \u2014 including carrying medical personnel to New York. Westchester County Airport did not start out as a commercial facility; it was built for the Air National Guard during World War II. The unit ended up moving to Stewart Airport in 1983. Had it remained in White Plains, it is unlikely that the county could shut down the airport. Smaller airports play a valuable role in many parts of the country, Mr. Oswald said. They are \u201chow are you receiving high-value, perishable cargo in your community or meeting the air-medical needs. It\u2019s the only access some communities have to the rest of the nation.\u201d",

    "title": "10 Women in Jazz Who Never Got Their Due - The New York Times",
    "text": "Young, female instrumentalists have been establishing a firmer footing in jazz, taking some of the music\u2019s  boldest creative steps  and  organizing for change  on a structural level. But this isn\u2019t an entirely new development. While we\u2019re often taught to think of jazz\u2019s history as a cavalcade of great men and their bands, from its beginnings in the early 20th century women played a range of important roles, including onstage. During World War II, right in the heart of the swing era, all-female bands became a sensation, filling the void left by men in the military. But in fact they were continuing a tradition that had begun in the vaudeville years and continued, albeit to a lesser degree, in jazz\u2019s early decades. Prevented from taking center stage, many female instrumentalists became composers, arrangers or  artists\u2019 managers . Buffeted by sexism from venue owners and record companies in the United States, they often went abroad to pursue careers in Europe or even Asia. As was also true of their male counterparts, the African-American women who helped blaze some of jazz\u2019s earliest trails had to innovate their way around additional roadblocks. \u201cThese jazz women were pioneers, and huge proponents in disseminating jazz and making it a global art form,\u201d said Hannah Grantham, a musicologist at the National Museum of African American History and Culture who studies the work of female jazz musicians and contributed notes to this list. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been given enough credit for that, because of their willingness to go everywhere.\u201d The piano and organ were considered more socially acceptable instruments for young women to play, and few serious fans of jazz would be unfamiliar with the names  Mary Lou Williams ,  Marian McPartland ,  Hazel Scott ,  Shirley Scott  or  Alice Coltrane . But the ranks of female jazz genius run much deeper than that. Here are 10 performers who made a big impression in their day, but are rarely as remembered as they should be in jazz\u2019s popular history. Lovie Austin composed for and accompanied some of the greatest singers of the early recording era, including Ma Rainey and Ethel Waters. A number of her songs became hits, including \u201cDown Hearted Blues,\u201d a smash for Bessie Smith that sold close to 800,000 copies. Based in Chicago, Austin was also a frequent bandleader at some of the Harlem Renaissance\u2019s most famous venues. Mary Lou Williams counted Austin as her largest inspiration. \u201cMy entire concept was based on the few times I was around Lovie Austin,\u201d she later said. Lil Hardin met her future husband Louis Armstrong in 1922, when he joined her as a member of King Oliver\u2019s famed Creole Jazz Band. Hardin, who studied at Fisk University and had an entrepreneurial streak, helped bring Armstrong forward as a bandleader, serving as his first manager, pianist and frequent co-composer. After they split up around 1930, she found some success with her own big band, but stepped away from performing years later after determining that male promoters would never be willing to promote her on the same level as men. Valaida Snow\u2019s career was a wildfire: a thing of great expanse and then rapid, wrenching exhaustion. She was  a master of the trumpet  but played a dozen other instruments, as well as singing, doing arrangements for orchestras, dancing, and appearing prominently in early Hollywood films. When the pioneering blues musician and composer W.C. Handy heard her play, he dubbed her \u201cQueen of the Trumpet.\u201d Denied a proper spotlight in Chicago and New York, Snow became a star abroad, touring for years in East Asia and Europe. She wound up stuck in Denmark during World War II, becoming ill while imprisoned there. She escaped in 1942 and spent the rest of her career back in the United States, although her health never recovered. As a grade-school student in Sioux City, Iowa, Peggy Gilbert quickly became accustomed to  cutting against the grain . The daughter of classical musicians, she was told in high school that the saxophone was unsuitable for a young woman \u2014 but she taught herself anyway. A year after graduating she started her first band, the Melody Girls. In 1938, outraged at an article in DownBeat magazine headlined \u201cWhy Women Musicians Are Inferior,\u201d she  penned a retort  that the magazine published in full. \u201cA woman has to be a thousand times more talented, has to have a thousand times more initiative even to be recognized as the peer of the least successful man,\u201d she wrote. Talent and initiative were two things Gilbert possessed. She went on to lead ensembles for decades, on the vaudeville circuit and the Los Angeles scene, eventually becoming an official with the musicians\u2019 union there. She continued to perform well into her 90s, and died at 102. Just like better-remembered contemporaries such as Fats Waller and Louis Jordan, Una Mae Carlisle made jazz that was also R&B and also pop \u2014 before the Billboard charts had effectively codified those genres. She was publicly known best as a singer, but she played virtuosic stride piano and composed prolifically too. Part black and part Native American, Carlisle was a pioneer in various ways, as Ms. Grantham pointed out. Carlisle was the first black woman to be credited as the composer of a song on the Billboard charts, and the first African-American to host her own regular, nationally broadcast radio show. She wrote for stars like Benny Goodman and Peggy Lee, and recorded her own hit singles, often with famous jazz musicians as her accompanists, before illness tragically shortened her career. Orphaned at age 6 and subsequently raised by her aunt and uncle, Ginger Smock showed extravagant talents early on. At 10, she performed at the Hollywood Bowl; a year later, she gave a solo recital at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles. She was the only black member of the Los Angeles Junior Philharmonic\u2019s all-student symphony, and soon after she apprenticed with the jazz pioneer  Stuff Smith . She then started an all-female trio, the Sepia Tones, that   was a centerpiece of the city\u2019s burgeoning   Central Avenue jazz scene, and she soon became \u201cpretty influential on the West Coast,\u201d Ms. Grantham said. Later, Smock hosted a full-length (though short-lived) show on Los Angeles\u2019s CBS affiliate, KTSL, in 1951, making hers the first black band to host a regular TV program. A blazing player whose personality was as big and effusive as her talents, Dorothy Donegan piled her mastery of classical, stride, boogie-woogie and modern jazz piano into boisterous, often ribald performances. An old-school performer at heart, she could amaze and amuse an audience in equal measure. Donegan\u2019s career was book ended by illustrious performances: In 1943, with dreams of becoming a professional classical pianist, she became the first black instrumentalist to give a concert at Orchestra Hall in Chicago. Time magazine covered it, and it set her on a path to renown, although a career in classical music was off-limits because of both her gender and her race. Fifty years later, she  performed at the White House  for President Bill Clinton. For all her accomplishments, Donegan made it clear in interviews that she felt sexism had prevented her from joining her male contemporaries in the music\u2019s pantheon. Hailing from Leipzig, Germany, Jutta Hipp taught herself jazz as a child growing up in the Third Reich,  secretly listening to international radio broadcasts . She was forced to flee her hometown at age 21, after the war left it in ruin; she supported herself by becoming a professional jazz pianist. Hipp eventually became the first woman bandleader to record for Blue Note Records, whose proprietors were German expatriates. But with true stardom escaping her, she eventually abandoned her career as a professional musician for the stability of job working with seamstresses, although she never totally gave up playing. A self-proclaimed \u201ctrumpetiste,\u201d Clora Bryant was part of the first generation of bebop musicians innovating in Los Angeles clubs, and she joined a handful of all-female ensembles in the years during and after World War II. Bryant became a featured soloist in the  International Sweethearts of Rhythm , the most famous ensemble of its kind, then joined the Queens of Rhythm. Through the esteemed trombonist Melba Liston she met Dizzy Gillespie, who became her mentor. And as her career went on, she mentored countless musicians herself as a respected elder on the L.A. scene. Bertha Hope\u2019s career bloomed alongside that of her husband  Elmo Hope , whose economic hard-bop style was not altogether different from hers. They released a joint album together in 1961, but after his untimely death she focused on raising their children, performing intermittently around the New York area and remaining close with many musicians on the scene. Years later, she remarried, to the bassist Walter Booker; since then she has recorded a handful of albums and become a respected elder among younger New York musicians, including the bassist Mimi Jones, who recently made a documentary about her mentor titled \u201cSeeking Hope.\u201d",

    "title": "Opinion | Who Is Driving Inequality? You Are - The New York Times",
    "text": "Who is driving inequality in America? You are. I am. We are. Did you read to your kids before bed when they were young? If you did, you gave them an advantage over kids whose parents were working the evening shift at 7-Eleven. Did you spend extra on tutoring or music lessons? Since 1996, affluent families  have spent  almost 300 percent more educating their young while everybody else\u2019s spending has been mostly flat. Did you marry before having kids and raise your kids in a two-parent home? The children of the well educated are now much more likely to grow up in stable families, and those differences in family structure explain 32 percent of the growth of family income inequality since 1979. If you did these things, you did nothing wrong. You invested in your children\u2019s flourishing as any decent parent would. But here\u2019s the situation: The information economy rains money on highly trained professionals \u2014 doctors, lawyers, corporate managers, engineers and so on. Daniel Markovits, author of \u201c The Meritocracy Trap ,\u201d estimates there are about one million of these workers in America today. They work really hard, are really productive and earn a lot more. In the mid-1960s, profits per partner at elite law firms were less than five times a secretary\u2019s salary. Now, Markovits notes, they are over 40 times. These professionals invest heavily in their children\u2019s education. By eighth grade, students from affluent families are four grade levels ahead of students from poor families. Seventy-two percent of students at the 150 most competitive colleges come from the richest quarter of families, and only 3 percent come from the poorest. Inherited inequality is bad enough. But it\u2019s the geographic concentration that is really turning America into a caste society. Affluent people used to be spread around: owning the local bank or factory, sending their kids to the local schools. Now those of us in the top 20 percent of earners are concentrated in talent-rich zones around New York, D.C., the Bay Area, etc. The already advantaged build rich communities and multiply one another\u2019s advantages even more. It takes a village to raise a Stanford grad. You don\u2019t have to drive very far outside these top 20 percent communities to find yourself in a different universe. In February I drove from Manhattan Beach, Calif., to Watts in South Central L.A. and Compton, where I spent a few days interviewing residents. People in Compton and Watts \u2014 almost exclusively Latino and black \u2014 talked about all the things that have been stripped away from their communities: good schools, public amenities, school choirs, music festivals. Fear was a constant subject of conversation. Most of the people I spoke with had lost a family member to gun violence. People spoke about intense levels of social distrust; the locals had been betrayed again and again by outsiders and now are very skeptical of people promising to make improvements. They talked about trauma. \u201cThere are Compton riots on the inside now,\u201d one resident told me. I chose to go to Compton and Watts for a specific reason, which offers a way forward. Harvard economist Raj Chetty recently led a  study  that showed that though these two neighborhoods are demographically similar and only 2.3 miles apart, 44 percent of the black men who grew up in Watts were incarcerated on April 1, 2010, compared with only 6.2 percent of the black men who grew up in families with similar incomes in Central Compton. Similarly, social mobility was much lower in Watts than in Compton. Why are some neighborhoods, including some in Compton, able to give their kids better chances in life despite so many disadvantages? Chetty points to several factors: better schools, more fathers present in the neighborhoods and more cohesive community organizations. I found all those things in my reporting in Compton \u2014 and something else. Watts is part of Los Angeles. Compton is its own city with its own mayor. I met a lot of great people in Watts, but Compton has more civic infrastructure \u2014 community groups and locally controlled government agencies. Compton has a lot of homegrown civic reformers, like Rafer Owens, who is a deputy Los Angeles County sheriff and pastor at a Baptist church. There\u2019s also a mentality: We have faith in our ability to take care of ourselves; only people in the neighborhood really know what\u2019s going on. Some people who talk about inequality focus on the top 1 percent, and if you want to go after the hedge fund billionaires feel free. But as inequality is actually lived out, it\u2019s the 20/80 gap that is most glaring and most unjust. But we can reduce the opportunity gap if we follow the lessons of Compton: First, the neighborhood is the unit of change. Social mobility rises village by village. Second, the people in the community have to be in charge. They need resources from outside, but only local control does the trick. Third, spending money on preschool, apprenticeship and other human capital programs really works. The top 20 percent is not going to stop spending heavily on their kids. We have to give the bottom 80 percent the resources to do the same. The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

    "title": "UN envoy: Israeli annexation can destroy Mideast peace hopes - The Washington Post",
    "text": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The U.N. Mideast envoy warned Thursday that Israeli moves to annex parts of the West Bank and accelerate settlement expansion, combined with the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s devastating impact, could ignite Israeli-Palestinian conflict and \u201cdestroy any hope of peace.\u201d Nickolay Mladenov told the U.N. Security Council that annexation would also \u201cconstitute a serious violation of international law, deal a devastating blow to the two-state solution, close the door to a renewal of negotiations, and threaten efforts to advance regional peace.\u201d He urged Israelis and Palestinians to support U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 call for a global cease-fire to all conflicts to tackle the pandemic. Mladenov, who is the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, expressed hope that opportunities for cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians as a result of the COVID-19 crisis \u201cwill not be undermined or destroyed if the political context between Israel and the Palestinian Authority deteriorates.\u201d Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the council that cooperation is already being undermined, blaming the threat of annexation. Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main political rival, Benny Gantz, signed a governing coalition agreement that includes a clause to advance plans to annex parts of the West Bank, including Israeli settlements, starting July 1. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem \u2014 areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 for an independent state and the removal of many of the more than 700,000 Israeli settlers from these areas. The U.S. rolled out its long-awaited Mideast peace plan in late January calling for a disjointed Palestinian state that would turn over key parts of the West Bank to Israel. It was immediately dismissed by the Palestinians. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday when asked about the annexation agreement in the Netanyahu-Gantz deal: \u201cThat\u2019s an Israeli decision.\u201d Mansour said the U.S. peace proposal and Israel\u2019s decision to proceed with annexation \u201cwill destroy the two-state solution and entrench Israel\u2019s military control over the Palestinian people and land.\u201d He urged \u201cdeterrent action\u201d be taken by the Security Council, General Assembly, parliaments, judicial bodies and other organizations to salvage prospects for peace. Earlier Thursday, the European Union warned the incoming Israeli government that annexing parts of the occupied West Bank \u201cwould constitute a serious violation of international law.\u201d France\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Nicolas de Riviere, went further, saying annexation \u201cwould not pass unchallenged and shall not be overlooked in our relationship with Israel.\u201d Neither Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon nor acting U.S. deputy ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet mentioned annexation in their briefings to the council, instead focusing on the fight against COVID-19 in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Chalet said the United States \u201chas been heartened to see signs of good will, humanity and unity between Israelis and Palestinians,\u201d highlighting Israel\u2019s training of four teams of Palestinian health care workers on the COVID-19 response and establishment of a control room by Israeli and Palestinian leaders to enhance coordination and communications. She said urged the council \u201cto help the parties choose true leadership over politics as usual, and to work together to ensure that the prospect of peace remains within reach.\u201d Danon said that \u201cIsrael has chosen to put aside politics\u201d and has strengthened cooperation with the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Israel is helping fund a U.N. emergency plan, has granted permits allowing thousands of Palestinians to work in Israel and has donated large amounts of equipment to the Palestinian Authority, he said. \u201cIn the past weeks, over 600 tons of medical supplies, 25,000 tons of food and 60,000 tons of building materials have entered the Gaza Strip.\u201d But Danon accused the Palestinians of accepting aid while it \u201cspreads lies and incites against Israel in the media and in official letters to the council.\u201d including blaming Israeli soldiers for the virus. Addressing the Palestinian ambassador, he said, \u201cThe Palestinian Authority must decide if incitement against Israel is more important than the fruitful cooperation intended to save Palestinian lives.\u201d Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "text": "\u00a0The United States will open a consulate in Greenland and give $12\u2009million in development aid to the Arctic island, which President Trump mused about  buying from Denmark last year . Danish and U.S. officials jointly announced the financial and diplomatic package Thursday, in what the Trump administration characterized as an effort to counter growing Russian and Chinese interest in the Arctic. The vast expanse of sparsely populated land above the Arctic Circle has become  a geopolitical battleground  as warming caused by climate change is opening new sea lanes and creating commercial and military activity unimaginable until recently. As the ice retreats, opportunities to tap potential oil and mineral resources could also arise. Both Russia and the United States, because of Alaska, are members of the Arctic Council, a cooperative group of eight nations, while China has unilaterally declared itself a \u201cnear-Arctic\u201d nation. The United States says Beijing is conjuring up a category that doesn\u2019t exist and considers it a thinly veiled effort to expand China\u2019s vision of blazing a \u201cPolar Silk Road.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a change that\u2019s driven by the desire of Russia and the People\u2019s Republic of China to challenge the United States and the West,\u201d said a senior State Department official, talking to reporters on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about geopolitical tensions rising in the frozen north. \u201cWe can expect the rapidly changing Arctic system to create greater incentives for the Kremlin and the PRC to pursue agendas that clash with the interests of the United States and our allies and partners,\u201d he added. When Trump expressed interest last year in purchasing Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, he was rebuffed and ridiculed at home as well as in Denmark and Greenland. \u201cGreenland is Greenlandic,\u201d said Prime Minister Kim Kielsen, declaring that it was not on the market. Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, called Trump\u2019s idea of buying Greenland  \u201cabsurd.\u201d The open mockery caused Trump to abruptly  cancel a planned state visit to Denmark , saying Frederiksen had been \u201cnasty\u201d when she rejected his proposal. More than a dozen countries already have consulates in Greenland, mostly from Europe but also South Korea and Canada. The United States previously had a diplomatic mission in Greenland\u2019s capital of Nuuk, a town of 18,000 inhabitants, from 1940 to 1953, as part of a bid to ward off the Nazis during World War II. Though the consulate has been long gone, the U.S. presence is maintained through Thule Air Base and $15\u2009million invested annually in some 50 research projects on the environment and sustainable development. The planned consulate and $12.1\u2009million from the United States Agency for International Development represents a \u201crebirth of our engagement in Greenland,\u201d the State Department official said. It will be targeted to help advance new and renewable energy technologies, develop fisheries management and expand tourism opportunities as Greenland strives to become the next frontier for high-adventure travelers, the official said. The official announcement of the package was preempted by the U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, who wrote in an online publication that the United States would offer \u201ca substantial package of economic aid\u201d to Greenland and would be \u201cthe preferred partner in the Arctic.\u201d In an opinion piece for the news outlet Altinget, Sands accused Russia of \u201caggressive behavior and increased militarization in the Arctic,\u201d and China of pursuing \u201cpredatory economic interests\u201d in Greenland. Her remarks prompted some opposition leaders in Denmark and Greenland to express skepticism of U.S. intentions, saying Washington was trying to expand its own interests. The State Department pushed back, saying its interests were peace and prosperity, and denied the aid is a subterfuge to buy Greenland outright. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should presume that the provision of assistance in any of these areas is designed to pave the way to purchase Greenland,\u201d the State Department official told reporters. \u201cWe provide this type of assistance around the world every day in many, many countries. Our intentions here are to deepen the partnership that exists already between the kingdom of Denmark, Greenland and the United States.\u201d The official characterized the move as \u201cgood, old-fashioned diplomatic tradecraft,\u201d designed to address shared economic, scientific and environmental challenges and keep the region free from conflict. Asked why Washington is not giving the money to the government of Denmark, the official said it will be jointly administered under existing procedures used by USAID and the Departments of State, Interior and Commerce. \u201cThey will go about that it in the same way that they do managing other programs globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plan or interagency process underway involving the purchase of Greenland.\u201d",

    "title": "'Digital poverty' in schools where few have laptops - BBC News",
    "text": "\"In our schools, 60% to 70% of children wouldn't have laptops,\" says Wayne Norrie, head of an academy trust with schools in disadvantaged areas. With schools closed and pupils studying online at home, he says, it is important to recognise the social gap in access to technology. \"Coronavirus has revealed the scale of the digital divide,\" he says. The Department for Education in England has promised laptops will be lent to some poorer teenagers. Year 10 pupils without access to a computer, and those with social workers, will be able to apply soon, with the first laptops promised in the next couple of weeks. Mr Norrie, chief executive of Greenwood Academies Trust, with 37 schools in the Midlands and east of England, says many families rely on a single mobile phone for an internet connection, which is \"not realistic\" for online learning and streaming video lessons. \"Many don't have broadband contracts,\" he says. The schools have been providing laptops and some families have their own tablet computers - but there are still barriers in terms of parents' IT skills and children having space to study. \"Digital poverty\" is a significant problem, says Matt Morden, co-head teacher of Surrey Square primary school, in south London. In his school, 24% of pupils are effectively offline, in terms of being able to study from home. Their families might have mobile phones with internet connections - but for those in low-paid, insecure jobs, data is expensive. \"If families are struggling, the priority is going to be food, not data,\" he says. As well as missing out on learning, those without online connections miss \"the sense of belonging\" from staying in touch with their friends and teachers, Mr Morden says. The lockdown and the closure of schools has \"brought the digital divide to the forefront\", he says. There has been a  new virtual academy launched  and the BBC has provided educational resources - but those without internet access or usable computer devices are being left behind. Mr Morden's school has been lending laptops - but for families with several school-age children, one might not be enough. Seb Chapleau, director of the Big Education Conversation charity, says it is \"important to understand that this is a deep problem across many schools\". The Co-op Academies Trust is providing 1,000 computer devices across its 24 schools. Chris Tomlinson, who chairs the trust, says online lessons are \"no good if the children don't have the necessary hardware to access the internet\". The AET academy trust, meanwhile, is providing 9,000 laptops across its 58 schools. Chief executive Julian Drinkall says the lockdown has made technology an educational necessity.  And Harlow MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the Education Select Committee, suggests educational programmes could be put on free-to-air television to reach those not online.",

    "title": "Coronavirus: What do all the terms mean? - BBC News",
    "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has introduced dozens of new words and phrases to daily life, from social distancing to herd immunity. But what do they all mean? Use our translator tool to look up and check the meaning of key terms. Asymptomatic A person who has a disease but is displaying no symptoms of that illness. A study of one village in Italy suggests 50-75% of Covid-19 cases there could be asymptomatic. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with coronavirus involved trying to catch cases early and trace anyone who had been in close contact Coronavirus A generic name for a group of viruses which cause illness and disease in humans and animals. The disease caused can be severe or mild. The common cold and influenza (flu) are examples of coronaviruses. Covid-19 Covid-19 is the name of the specific disease caused by the type of coronavirus first detected in Wuhan in China in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK strategy to deal with coronavirus involves delaying its spread by introducing 'social distancing' where people avoid close contact with others by working from home, avoiding public transport and restricting major events. Flatten the curve Describes measures to prevent a very high number of cases of disease occurring at the same time and potentially overloading health services. By slowing transmission rates through measures like social distancing, cases take place over a longer period of time and hospitals remain within capacity - the 'peak' of cases is flattened into a smoother curve on a chart. Flu Flu is a virus which routinely causes disease in humans and animals. There are two main types or strains of flu, A and B. These are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics. Herd immunity Describes how the spread of a disease can be limited by a certain number of people (or animals) being exposed to it and acquiring immunity, therefore slowing its spread. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off disease is said to be immune to that disease. Once a person has recovered from Covid-19, they are thought to have some immunity to the disease - that is, they cannot get it again - for a certain period of time. However how long immunity lasts is not known, and there have been some reports of people testing positive for a second time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and the body starting to display symptoms. Lockdown Any restriction on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people urged to remain at home behind closed doors. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of disease. Mitigation phase The fourth part of the UK's strategy to deal with coronavirus involves mitigating the impact of a high number of case on public services. This could mean the NHS stopping all non-critical care and police only responding to major crimes and emergencies. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone line which offers medical advice to anyone who rings it. Anyone who suspects they may have coronavirus symptoms is asked to call NHS 111 rather than attend a GP surgery or hospital A&E. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occuring rapidly, either in a cluster or in multiple locations, is known as an outbreak. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in several countries simultaneously is known as a pandemic. Quarantine Means the isolation of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to prevent it spreading to others. Sars Sars or SARS refers to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a type of coronavirus which emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Means staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people with the aim of preventing any possible spread of disease. Social distancing Taking measures to avoid coming into direct contact with others. This can mean avoiding any social gatherings, and in daily life, keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from other people. State of emergency Usually refers to measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even possibly deploying the armed forces to support regular emergency services. Symptoms Symptoms are any outward physical sign of disease, such as a cough, sore throat or fever. They are triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. Vaccine A substance which causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Virus A tiny agent which replicates inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease.",

    "title": "10 songs supporting the world through lockdown - BBC News",
    "text": "With around half the world's population living under social distancing rules, many of us are turning to our favourite tunes for comfort. They're helping us to reflect, grieve or even dance around while we follow orders to stay at home. BBC Minute's team - which provide 24/7 news bulletins for radio stations around the world - believe any challenge can be faced with the right music. We even have a motivational poster that reads: \"Make a coffee, put on some gangsta rap, and handle it.\" It seems that's a view shared by our partner stations in 100 cities across 40 countries. We asked their presenters which songs they're playing to help their listeners get through the pandemic. Consider it your lockdown playlist. Many Nigerians are missing their nights out right now, if the #BopDaddyChallenge is anything to go by. It's a TikTok trend, Ronke explains.  Those who would normally go to nightclubs have been taking to social media instead. They picture themselves transitioning from pyjamas into glamorous evening-wear - as if by magic. \"They're getting all made up\u2026 to go nowhere!\" she laughs. The soundtrack to the challenge is a tune by rapper-comedian Falz. \"It really is just a guy talking about himself, and how he's going to be your everything,\" says Ronke.  \"The lyrics may not always make much sense, but the important thing is that it's fun to dance to while at home.\" End of Youtube post  by FalzVEVO Billie Eilish's sombre song recounts a nightmare in which she takes her own life - but nobody cares. It's hardly music to blast away the lockdown blues. But news reporter Tebogo insists it's an apt choice for the present time, which is why Gabz FM has been playing it loads.  \"It relates to the state of mind Botswana is in,\" he says. \"There's a bit of uncertainty. You're not sure where things are going to end up. But you have no choice other than to remain hopeful.\" In her track, Eilish ultimately finds solace in those people closest to her, namely her brother Finneas.  End of Youtube post  by BillieEilishVEVO John Lennon's famous song appeals for unity and compassion. And Michael at Hong Kong's Metro Plus thinks people in Hong Kong are already showing each other more love than usual.  \"You see a person without a mask by the roadside and someone will be giving him a helping hand. Before, they wouldn't have even looked at that guy,\" he says. \"This struggle is not between an Asian and an American, an American and a European, or a European and an African. \"Humans are up against something (coronavirus) we can't even see.  If all we come together, as this song asks, we'll get through it.\" End of Youtube post  by johnlennon Asfandyar's tricky task is to create \"positive content\" during the pandemic. His team have chosen to rework a traditional song, which he says gives people courage. \"It makes them feel like defenders. They're an army. Why? Because they're staying home, keeping themselves and their families safe.\" His playlists follow a daily rhythm. In the mornings, people want energetic pop to exercise to. By 5pm, it's time for something more reflective.  \"That's when the sun sets, and we play songs like this to give them hope again for tomorrow. Music is the thing here which is calming people down.\" End of Youtube post  by Power99.live Lockdown has made radio more crucial than ever in rural northern Uganda. Okeng's breakfast show has a feel-good feature in which the station calls up two people who want to connect with each other but lack the means (pay-as-you-go phone credit) - and it's proving popular with couples.  As well as dating each other via radio, Gulu's young lovers are said to be coping with their new separation by requesting an elegant Afro-fusion love song by local artist BeePee. \"The song means, 'have me in your heart during the good times, but also the bad times',\" Okeng explains.  End of Youtube post  by PINE AVENUE5 Due to increased pressure on the internet, some of us are glad to just Skype a friend without having issues. But, miraculously, the seven members of Dubioza Kolektiv manage to use video-calling to jam out songs even while each musician stays at home.  Radio Antena likes to play the best bits from these live sessions. \"Wash your hands!\" urges this eccentric (but informative) tune.  Antena's mostly English-language playlist rarely gets more Balkan than the odd Dua Lipa track. But presenter Naida says the coronavirus has raised demand for Bosnian artists.  \"People are listening to us all over the world. A lot of people left here during the [1992-95] war. Right now, they're missing home. They want to hear their language, and to know what's happening here.\" End of Youtube post  by Dubioza kolektiv Recorded back in 1988, Resistir\u00e9 has re-emerged as a defiant hymn, belted out from apartment balconies in virus-hit Spain.  \"It's different to a song like [Gloria Gaynor's] I Will Survive,\" says Valeria at Metropolis FM. \"It's not about saying, 'I made it'. Instead it's about saying, 'I will fight this'.\" A star-studded 2020 cover version has become her most requested song. Uruguay has not yet been badly hit by Covid-19, Valeria says, but people here are watching the rest of the world anxiously.  \"A lot of them have relatives in Spain. Or they're terribly worried about family in the United States.\" End of Youtube post  by Warner Music Spain \"The stone that the builder refuse / Shall be the head cornerstone.\"  Maya loves these Bob Marley lyrics. She thinks they mean that every underdog will have its day. Protesters calling for political changes in Sudan in 2019 adopted the reggae icon as something of a \"freedom symbol\", and he remains popular with young artists and activists a year later.  Many Sudanese continue to feel marginalised, Maya says. But now it's as a result of coronavirus restrictions, which could hit the country's poorest.  So, she keeps playing Marley, \"no longer as a revolutionary voice, but as a calming father figure who says, 'you're going to get through this'\". End of Youtube post  by Bob Marley \"It's our anthem,\" says Moustafa of this 70s floor-stomper.  \"Any time we face a challenge at the radio station, we have a saying: 'We will rock this; this is not a problem for us.' And the same thing goes for the listeners. Whenever they're feeling down, they always request We Will Rock You.\" For Moustafa, lockdown is further proof of how radio offers young Iraqis an escape from their daily struggles.  Turns out it's therapeutic for the DJ, too. \"Just as listeners tell me their problems, I tell them mine. So, it's back and forth, which is awesome.\" End of Youtube post  by Queen Official Translated as Our Home, this karaoke-ready tune has taken on a new meaning at Jakarta's Smart FM. Presenter Hisa is playing it for people who are ignoring social distancing restrictions.  \"We want to invite them to stay at home and be observant of the rules,\" she explains. \"The song's message is all about how great Indonesia is: no matter where you go in the world, it's always more comfortable here. And, right now, it's best to stay not just in Indonesia, but in our homes.\" No official video available.",

    "title": "Coronavirus: Wales lockdown rules tightened over second homes - BBC News",
    "text": "Some lockdown rules in Wales are being made stricter to \"address challenges being faced in parts of the country\", the first minister has said. Updated regulations, announced by Mark Drakeford, make it clear people cannot remain away from the place they live. The changes are intended to clamp down on the use of second homes and discourage people from exercising outside their local area. Separately, Mr Drakeford will announce a framework later for exiting lockdown. The new rules, which will come into force on Saturday, also include extending social distancing rules to hospital, school and prison canteens. However, businesses offering a \"click and collect\" service will be allowed to reopen as long as they observe social distancing rules. Families with children who have certain learning difficulties, including autism, will be allowed to leave the house more than once a day. Announcing the changes, the first minister said: \"The changes we are introducing supplement the rules already in force, but they respond to some challenges being faced in parts of the country and by families throughout Wales. \"Our message has not changed - anyone can get coronavirus, anyone can spread it. So please, stay home, protect the NHS, and save lives.\" The Welsh Government will also publish a framework later for how Wales could move out of the lockdown. It will include questions to consider before decisions are made around relaxing restrictions. BBC Wales has been told these will be: While the Welsh Government is broadly working together with the UK and other devolved governments on the lockdown measures, the rules are made on a per-country basis. Mr Drakeford has already said he would be prepared to \"do things differently\" to the other nations if that was right for Wales. On Thursday, the Scottish Government published its lockdown exit strategy warning that people would have to \"adapt to a new reality\".",

    "title": "The volunteer army helping self-isolating neighbours - BBC News",
    "text": "The coronavirus outbreak has left many people feeling trapped indoors - but tens of thousands of volunteers have offered to help them out. It was late at night on Thursday 12 March when Aviah Sarah Day realised things were serious. Five days earlier she'd thought nothing of going to a nightclub packed with sweaty revellers.  Now, as the latest news about the coronavirus outbreak came in, it began to dawn on her just how difficult life was about to become for the millions of British people who would end up stuck inside their homes. And then, as she sat on her sofa looking at the newsfeed on her phone, she saw something that gave her hope. In Lewisham, across the river in south London,  a Facebook group had been set up  for people who wanted to offer their services to neighbours who might be confined to their homes as a result of the outbreak - to fetch their groceries, walk their dogs, pick up prescriptions or simply have a chat over the phone or Skype if they were feeling lonely or frightened. So Day, who is 32 and a university lecturer, set up  a Facebook group for Hackney too . By the time she went to bed, no-one had joined: \"I thought no-one was interested,\" she recalls. But when she woke up in the morning, the group had hundreds of members. Today it has nearly 7,000.  Since it became clear just how widespread self-isolation would become, tens of thousands of people have been thinking the same way as Day.    Lewisham was the first, but by the end of the weekend, there were several hundred around the UK. WhatsApp and Nextdoor proved popular tools as well as Facebook.  Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK , an umbrella organisation for these spontaneous community groups from Caithness to Cornwall, says there are now over 1,000. The community organising group,  Acorn , has a web page connecting volunteers with people in need too. Some local groups cover entire cities. Others are focused on individual streets, estates or a single block of flats. The motivation among volunteers is broadly the same - to do what they can to help their neighbours, especially those in greatest need. \"As a young person who's not at a high risk of dying, you feel responsible,\" says 17-year-old student Eleanor Anrade May, who helped set up the Devon Mutual Aid Group. And for many volunteers, at a time of widespread panic and unease, the ability to do something - anything - provides at least a tiny measure of control over the situation. A week on, Day - who helped set up groups covering the Redbridge local authority area (where she lives) and Barking and Dagenham too - is consumed by the work in hand. Throughout the day her phone pings with messages and updates, and there are virtual meetings on the Zoom app (which people who are self-isolating can also take part in). In east London, there are Facebook groups for each borough and WhatsApp groups at ward and sometimes street level. Signing up as a volunteer is one thing, finding a system that matches all the jobs that need doing - leafleting homes with offers of support, delivering groceries, fetching vital medicines - is another.  \"There's people going out leafleting, there's people doing Facebook admin roles,\" Day says. Not all generate equal levels of enthusiasm: \"There are some more popular tasks than others, and dog-walking is definitely up there,\" she adds. But so far at least there are still enough bodies to go around. It's not just about making sure households are stocked up with milk and bread, either. Ensuring people have some kind of connection to the outside world is a priority, too. One of the cases that has affected Day most was an older man with HIV, who was self-isolating. \"He was feeling a bit lonely and just wanted to chat to somebody.\" He was put in touch with volunteers who spoke to him by phone. Some of those who've volunteered have already seen their good deed repaid. Hannah Martin, 31, was keen to help out in any way she could. She signed up to her local WhatsApp group in Denmark Hill, South London, and her phone number was added to a leaflet delivered through the doors of nearby streets offering support to anyone who needed it. Then she started coughing. Her partner developed a fever. Neither of them had a thermometer, so they asked the group for one. \"Lo and behold a thermometer was dropped at the door,\" she says. Although she didn't see herself as a particularly vulnerable person, she valued the sense of feeling cared for as she began her self-isolation. \"It's a really nice feeling, being looked after by your neighbours.\" The benefits of setting up a group like this might be obvious, but anyone who does so quickly encounters countless practical difficulties. For instance, what does data protection law say about maintaining databases of volunteers and those who need help? What about safeguarding them if they're vulnerable? Do you need to carry out a criminal record check? What's the most hygienic way of delivering a leaflet or a bag of groceries? These are issues the groups have had to get to grips with quickly, and all at once. It's compounded by the fact that they've grown exponentially in just a few days.  Jamie Haxby, 31, is an outreach worker for a church in Lancaster. When it set up the  Lancaster Coronavirus Response Support Line , its Facebook page rapidly attracted more than 1,000 members. He found himself speaking to a woman who lived hundreds of miles away in Kent - her parents, both in their 80s, live in Lancaster and it reassured her to know they had a source of support.  Haxby was able to draw on his own experience of working closely with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations, as well the specialist skills of other church members. One was a software engineer; he set up a platform which allows volunteers to submit an application for a Disclosure and Barring Service background check, and once they are cleared, allocates them to a particular job and alerts them by text. The Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK umbrella group has  guidance for things like hygiene, safeguarding, data protection and running meetings online .  Haxby warns that smaller groups with less experience and wherewithal could quickly find themselves out of their depth, facing a host of unforeseen problems. The most important thing to remember, he says, is keeping it simple: \"We're a bit limited in terms of what we can do - leave stuff, pick stuff up, speak to them on the phone.\" Given the widespread use of Facebook as an organising tool, there is also unease about the capacity for the social media platform and others like it to spread false rumours and misinformation. It's a big concern for John Morris, 27, who set up  Nottingham Covid-19 Mutual Aid  on Saturday and found himself \"running a small NGO within two days\" - its Facebook page now has over 15,000 members. A crucial early task was organising a rota of 20 moderators to enforce one of the page's key rules - any health advice shared on it can only come from reputable sources such as the NHS, the government or the World Health Organization. Photos of empty shelves were banned too: \"So no toilet roll posts,\" he says. \"We don't want to get people panicking.\" And for Day, one of the most important functions of the groups has been to deepen her faith in human nature. The footage of panic-buying doesn't tell the full story, she says. \"This has shown me that people want to help each other.\"",

    "title": "Fear and a firing inside an Amazon warehouse - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN Business) For nearly three years, Bashir Mohamed worked night shifts at  an Amazon warehouse  in Shakopee, Minnesota. As a \"stower\" at the facility, he was responsible for registering products into an inventory system before storing them on shelves for others to pick and pack. It was \"fairly stressful\" work, the 28 year old said, but he stuck with it in large part out of loyalty to his colleagues. Like many at this particular  Amazon   ( AMZN )  facility, Mohamed is of Somali descent. During his years at the warehouse, he played a central role in organizing for better protections for his colleagues. Mohamed, an avid news consumer, said he began voicing concerns in February about the threat coronavirus could pose to workers and later advocated for greater worker protections as the pandemic worsened in the United States. Mohamed distributed paper petitions to workers in Somali and English and said he expressed concerns to management about what he called the impossibility of practicing social distancing in the facility. To his surprise, Mohamed said he was given a \"final warning\" in late March for allegedly not following the recommendation for six feet of social distancing while speaking to a colleague in the parking lot, an incident he said he asked for proof of but was not given. He was ultimately fired earlier this month for what Amazon claims, in a statement to CNN Business, was \"a result of progressive disciplinary action for inappropriate language, behavior, and violating social distancing guidelines.\" But Mohamed has a different view. \"They fired me to make others scared,\" he told CNN Business. \"I was the top target.\"  Mohamed's firing, and the concerns expressed about it by several of his colleagues to CNN Business,  highlight the tension  between Amazon and its warehouse workers over safety and benefits during an unprecedented  public health crisis.  With their health potentially on the line, there has been renewed worker activism at a number of Amazon facilities during the pandemic -- and with it, claims by workers that Amazon is retaliating. Amazon denies those claims. Mohamed and another worker at the facility were the  second  and  third  known employees at Amazon distribution facilities in the US who were fired earlier this month. In late March, Christian Smalls -- who led a protest outside Amazon's Staten Island facility over the company's response to coronavirus --  was the first to be terminated.  (The company  similarly said  Smalls had \"received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines\" and was fired after attending a worker protest at the facility despite being under a 14-day quarantine.) In a statement about Mohamed's firing, and allegations of retaliation, Amazon spokesperson Kristen Kish told CNN Business the company has \"zero tolerance for retaliation against employees who raise concerns and respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so; however, these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.\" The e-commerce giant has seen  soaring demand  for its products and services during the pandemic as people stay home and increasingly look to Amazon as a lifeline for household essentials. But it has also become the subject of increased scrutiny as warehouse workers  express concerns  about a range of issues \u2014 from crowded hiring events and training sessions to limited access to disinfectant wipes and the company's overall ability to follow through on its commitments. There have been  numerous cases  of Amazon warehouse employees testing positive for coronavirus in the US and  around the world.  Amazon told CNN Business there have not been any confirmed cases at the Shakopee location to date. Amazon, which has 400,000 employees across 110 fulfillment centers in North America, has not provided much information concerning the number of confirmed cases at its facilities. When asked  on CNN last week , Amazon's top spokesperson Jay Carney said, \"I don't have a specific number.\" Inside Shakopee Inside the Shakopee facility, the potential for confusion or miscommunication is particularly high, some workers said. Many are immigrants whose first language is not English. A large contingent, like Mohamed, are Somali or East African; Minnesota has the  largest population  of Somalis in the US, with nearly 49,000 Somali residents, according to a  2018 Economic Status of Minnesotans report.   To staff its Shakopee facility, which opened in 2016 and has over 1,000 employees, Amazon made a concerted effort to recruit East African immigrants, according to  the New York Times .  Roughly 80% of Somalis in Minnesota are living at or  near poverty level , according to the same economic report. (Amazon declined to comment on the demographic breakdown of Shakopee facility workers.) \"The workforce in any given community reflects the community around it,\" Dania Rajendra, the director of the  Athena , a coalition of organizations focused on confronting Amazon's growing power. \"Amazon's communications about its changing policies and about what to expect at work is uneven at best. When you add language barriers into an already failing communication mechanism, it just exacerbates all of those challenges.\"  Mohamed, who commuted to the facility from where he lives in Minneapolis, about 40 minutes away, speaks English and Somali. He said he had been communicating with colleagues in the facility about coronavirus in English because his colleagues speak a mix of languages, including Spanish.   Some Shakopee workers told CNN Business about what they called a lack of clarity around new policies. In some cases, even those who do understand English well said they are having trouble keeping up with the pace of updates that come in various forms. Sahro Sharif, an Amazon associate at Shakopee, said the company recently implemented rules on which stairs could be accessed to minimize contact with others. \"One you can only go up and the other you can only come down,\" said Sharif. \"I never even noticed the sign until someone said something to me.\"  Amazon said it encourages employees to communicate concerns to management and that all facilities communicate policy updates in a variety of ways, including through on-site teams focused on educating employees about safety measures.  The company has instituted a number of changes at facilities across the country in response to the pandemic. That has included: staggering shift start times and break times to reduce congestion,  temperature screenings  at the beginning of shifts, and in recent days, requiring workers to wear masks provided by the company. The company said it has made  over 150 process  updates to date to ensure the health and safety of its employees.  Mohamed, and some of his coworkers, feel he was singled out for speaking up. \"It seems like what they're trying to say is if this warehouse is dangerous, it's dangerous because of the workers -- not because we have hundreds of workers coming in, touching surfaces or because we are bringing on hundreds of new hires and continuing to ship non-essential stuff,\" said William Stolz, an Amazon associate at the facility and friend of Mohamed's.   \"At the same time, they've used some of their policies, and the ways they've applied them, to target certain people who have been involved in organizing or people who have had more disagreements with management,\" Stolz added. A history of worker complaints and activism Before coronavirus, Amazon had been criticized  over safety concerns  and treatment of its workers, including by some at the Shakopee facility. In 2018 and 2019, Minnesota workers, including those CNN Business spoke to for this article, helped  lead protests  against the company  over issues  including what they viewed as unrealistic productivity rates. For some, like Hibaq Mohamed, another Somali immigrant who has worked as an Amazon associate for more than three and a half years at the Shakopee facility and has advocated for changes, getting coronavirus poses a risk not just to her health but also to that of her sister and her sister's two children, one of whom has severe asthma. She called the warehouse conditions, which she said are crowded as the company continues to  add new hires , \"unacceptable, scary and disappointing.\"  The company is providing  two weeks of paid leave  for those who have confirmed cases of the coronavirus or are placed in quarantine. It is also offering unlimited unpaid time off. Amazon said it moved all new hire events and orientations to virtual platforms on March 23. \"They say, if you're worried about it to go home without pay. We're living paycheck to paycheck, that's impossible,\" Hibaq said. \"When we speak up, we receive what Bashir received. [Amazon is] not focusing on how to protect the community from this coronavirus spreading -- they focus on how to shut us up.\"  Workers and organizations have filed  complaints  with the federal government   to call attention to issues inside several warehouses across the country. Awood, a Minnesota-based nonprofit that advocates for East African workers, filed an Occupation Safety and Health Administration  complaint  in early April after an employee at the Shakopee facility was believed by their doctor to have coronavirus. In the complaint, Awood said the company needs to communicate this to workers, as well as close and clean the warehouse and ensure workers do not have to choose between their jobs and their health.  The company said it shares with employees when there is a confirmed case where they work. Last Wednesday, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar called for a  federal investigation  into the firing of Mohamed and the other employee at the facility. In her letter, she called the firings \"outrageous\" and said they were \"a clear violation of whistleblower protection provisions.\" \"These accusations are simply unfounded,\" said Amazon's Kish. \"Nothing is more important than the safety of our teams. Since the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with health authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates and teams.\" Meanwhile, Mohamed, who continues to consult with his now former colleagues about coronavirus through a WhatsApp group, said he plans to file for unemployment. \"My goal,\" he said, \"is to create a safe place.\"",

    "title": "Trouble in farm country because of Covid-19 (opinion) - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) Recognition of the Covid-19 threat to the food supply and  its workers  has followed a peculiar sequence -- from table to farm. Attention first turned to those who sell or deliver food and the risks of contact with customers. Next, Covid-19 cases were seen among  grocery workers  and food distributors, whose vulnerability had been less appreciated until people started to die.  More recently, large outbreaks have been reported among workers in meat processing plants. A Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota,  closed after  644 workers got sick. At Cargill Meat Solutions in Hazelton, Pennsylvania, 130 workers  were infected  and a union leader died. And a JBS plant in Grand Island, the largest city in Hall County, Nebraska, reported 588  cases  in a population of  about 50,000 .   Alarmingly, this outbreak also has spread into local health care facilities and nursing homes.     One final group must now be recognized:  farm workers,  especially migrants. Spring brings workers to harvest early crops and many have begun to arrive at the farms where they have worked for years.    The result could be trouble. In Singapore, which has run the tightest, most well designed and executed Covid-19 control program in the world, migrant workers have been  among those caught up  in a large second wave of cases, likely related to their cramped and insufficient housing. Some dormitories in Singapore have 12 to 20 workers in a single room.     Migrant farm workers in the United States -- the majority of  whom are Latino  and too often living in comparably crowded, unsanitary quarters -- may similarly end up at the center of the next Covid-19 hot spots. Should that happen, the result may not only be disease and suffering, but also anti-immigrant scorn and blame, even as the problem -- unacceptable worker housing -- remains unaddressed.   Some groups have  sounded the alarm , but the issue has barely registered nationally. A few states with large migrant worker populations, however, are preparing. Oregon and North Dakota have begun to  consider  appropriate steps aimed at improved housing.    A few weeks ago, even  before a spike  of 100 cases at a wind power plant in Grand Forks, North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring, in a statement  suggested a response for containing  Covid-19. \"Agriculture producers are ramping up for spring's work and getting ready to get out into their fields,\" he said. \"Many of these producers rely on H-2A (foreign) workers and workers from other states to fill employment gaps. Producers who have workers arriving from other countries or states should follow proper (containment) procedures upon their arrival.\"   Randy Hatzenbuhler, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation in Medora, North Dakota, set a higher bar: He stated that any worker coming from out of state for seasonal work would be quarantined for two weeks. And he  promised that , \"While quarantined, those employees will be paid their normal wage and will have meal delivery available to them.\"  This approach may prevent a worker bringing infection into a community but will not prevent spread in overcrowded housing if a single case is introduced. Take, for example, sparsely populated Mountrail County, North Dakota,  population 10,545.  There, 33 cases of Covid-19  have been diagnosed , for an  infection rate of 323 per 100,000 , a  rate  higher than that of St. Louis.   The source of the Mountrail cases is not known. Mountrail County abuts the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, and cases  have been diagnosed  there as well.  However transmission is occurring, Mountrail County has  substantial farmlands . It is difficult to know how many migrant workers may spend time there this season. However,  according to  the Environmental Working Group's Farm Subsidy Database, in 2019, 334 farms in Mountrail County received $6.9 million in federal farm subsidies, suggesting many farms with many crops to harvest. The combination of community spread, as is likely occurring in the county, with a seasonal influx of farm workers may lead to a substantial increase in Covid-19 infections. The problem of inadequate housing for migrant workers is an old and poorly resolved one. In the 1970s, the Department of Justice  tried to address  the problem but a substantial gap remains.    A  report  from The Pew Charitable Trusts demonstrated that basic sanitary conditions are often not present. Bedbugs, crowding and shared bathrooms make daily life not only uncomfortable, but -- with Covid-19 -- potentially fatal.     Migrant farm workers are critical infrastructure workers. Their lack of safe housing is unfortunately in line with recent failures to protect most other critical infrastructure workers.     Preventable deaths  among police  officers,  health care  and  transportation  workers, as well as among those in the food industry will continue to occur. Many of these deaths occurred because of the unacceptable lack of protective gear or safe work conditions,  even after guidance  from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on critical worker safety.    This cruel abrogation of the basic social contract should rattle the many people who feel like the government \"has their back\" as they ready themselves to \"reopen\" an economy that for now, given the very low testing rates, should remain closed.    Any society that has proven unable or unwilling to protect critical infrastructure personnel surely has no plan to reduce risk for those planning to return to work in states such as Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. People hoping to resume business soon should consider this record of indifference before deciding their next steps.",

    "title": "Coronavirus: Why are international comparisons difficult? - BBC News",
    "text": "Everyone wants to know how well their country is tackling coronavirus, compared with others. But you have to make sure you're comparing the same things.  The United States, for example, has far more Covid-19 deaths than any other country - as of 20 April, a total of over 40,000 deaths.  But the US has a population of 330 million people.  If you take the five largest countries in Western Europe - the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain - their combined population is roughly 320 million.  And the total number of registered coronavirus deaths from those five countries, as of 20 April, was over 85,000 - more than twice that of the US.  So, individual statistics don't tell the full story.  For comparisons to be useful, says Rowland Kao, professor of data science at the University of Edinburgh, there are two broad issues to consider. \"Does the underlying data mean the same thing? And does it make sense to compare two sets of numbers if the epidemiology [all the other factors surrounding the spread of the disease] is different?\" Let's look at some of the numbers first. There are differences in how countries record Covid-19 deaths. France, for example, includes deaths in care homes in the headline numbers it produces every day, but the daily headline figures for England only include deaths in hospitals. There's also no accepted international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes.  Does somebody need to have been tested for coronavirus to count towards the statistics, or are the suspicions of a doctor enough? Does the virus need to be the main cause of death, or does any mention on a death certificate count?  Are you really comparing like with like? There is a lot of focus on death rates, but  there are different ways of measuring them  too. One is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of all the people who test positive for coronavirus, how many go on to die? But different countries are testing in very different ways. The UK has mainly tested people who are ill enough to be admitted to hospital. That can make the death rate appear much higher than in a country which had a wider testing programme. The more testing a country carries out, the more it will find people who have coronavirus with only mild symptoms, or perhaps no symptoms at all.  So, the death rate in confirmed cases is not the same as the overall death rate.   Another measurement is how many deaths have occurred compared with the size of a country's population - the numbers of deaths per million people, for example.  But that is determined partly by what stage of the outbreak an individual country has reached. If a country's first case was early in the global outbreak, then it has had longer for its death toll to grow.  The UK government compares how each country has done since recording its 50th death, but even that poses some problems. A country that reaches 50 deaths later should have had more time to prepare for the virus and reduce the eventual death toll. When studying these comparisons, it is also worth remembering that the vast majority of people who get infected with coronavirus will recover.  It is more difficult to have confidence in data which comes from countries with tightly controlled political systems.  Is the number of deaths recorded so far in countries like China or Iran accurate? We don't really know.  Calculated as a number of deaths per million of its population, China's figures are extraordinarily low, even after  it revised upwards the death toll in Wuhan by 50% .  So, can we really trust the data? There are real differences in the populations in different countries. Demographics are particularly important - that's things like average age, or where people live.  Comparisons have been made between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but they are problematic. Ireland has a much lower population density, and a much larger percentage of people live in rural areas.  It makes more sense to compare Dublin City and County with an urban area in the UK of about the same size (like Merseyside) than to try to compare the two countries as a whole.  You also need to make sure you are comparing like with like in terms of age structure.  A comparison of death rates between countries in Europe and Africa wouldn't necessarily work, because countries in Africa tend to have much younger populations.  We know that older people are much more likely to die of Covid-19. On the other hand, most European countries have health systems that are better funded than those in most African countries. And that will also have an effect on how badly hit a country is by coronavirus, as will factors such as how easily different cultures adjust to social distancing.  Health systems obviously play a crucial role in trying to control a pandemic, but they are not all the same.  \"Do people actively seek treatment, how easy is it to get to hospitals, do you have to pay to be treated well? All of these things vary from place to place,\" says Prof Andy Tatem, of the University of Southampton. Another big factor is the level of comorbidity - this means the number of other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure - which people may already have when they get infected. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, seem to have been most successful in slowing the spread of the disease so far.  Both Germany and South Korea have had far fewer deaths than the worst affected countries. The number of tests per head of population may be a useful statistic to predict lower fatality rates.  But not all testing data is the same - some countries record the number of people tested, while others record the total number of tests carried out (many people need to be tested more than once to get an accurate result). The timing of testing, and whether tests took place mostly in hospitals or in the community, also need to be taken into account.  Germany and South Korea tested aggressively very early on, and learned a lot more about how the virus was spreading. But Italy, which has also done a lot of tests, has suffered a relatively high numbers of deaths.  Italy only substantially increased its capacity for testing after the pandemic had already taken hold. The UK is doing the same thing.  So, is anything useful likely to emerge from all these comparisons?  \"What you want to know is why one country might be doing better than another, and what you can learn from that,\" says Prof Jason Oke from the University of Oxford.  \"And testing seems to be the most obvious example so far.\"  But until this outbreak is over it won't be possible to know for sure which countries have dealt with the virus better. \"That's when we can really learn the lessons for next time,\" says Prof Oke.

    "title": "Jobless Numbers Are \u2018Eye-Watering\u2019 but Understate the Crisis - The New York Times",
    "text": "Nearly a month after Washington rushed through an emergency package to aid jobless Americans, millions of laid-off workers have still not been able to apply for those benefits \u2014 let alone receive them \u2014 because of overwhelmed state unemployment systems. Across the country, states have frantically scrambled to handle a flood of applications and apply a new set of federal rules even as more and more people line up for help. On Thursday, the  Labor Department reported  that another 4.4 million people filed initial unemployment claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million. \u201cAt all levels, it\u2019s eye-watering numbers,\u201d Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said. Nearly one in six American workers has lost a job in recent weeks. Delays in delivering benefits, though, are as troubling as the sheer magnitude of the figures, he said. Such problems not only create immediate hardships, but also affect the shape of the recovery when the pandemic eases. Laid-off workers need money quickly so that they can continue to pay rent and credit card bills and buy groceries. If they can\u2019t, Mr. Slok said, the hole that the larger economy has fallen into \u201cgets deeper and deeper, and more difficult to crawl out of.\u201d Hours after the Labor Department report, the House passed a $484 billion coronavirus relief package to replenish a depleted small-business loan program and fund hospitals and testing. The Senate  approved the bill  earlier this week. Even as Congress continues to provide aid, distribution has remained challenging. According to the Labor Department, only 10 states have started making payments under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which extends coverage to freelancers, self-employed workers and part-timers. Most states have not even completed the system needed to start the process. Ohio, for example, will not start processing claims under the expanded federal eligibility criteria until May 15. Recipients whose state benefits ran out, but who can apply for extended federal benefits, will not begin to have their claims processed until May 1. Pennsylvania opened its website for residents to file for the federal program a few days ago, but some applicants were mistakenly told that they were ineligible after filling out the forms. The state has given no timetable for when benefits might be paid. Reports of delays, interruptions and glitches continue to come in from workers who have been unable to get into the system, from others who filed for regular state benefits but have yet to receive them, and from applicants who say they have been unfairly turned down and unable to appeal. Florida has paid just 17 percent of the claims filed since March 15, according to the state\u2019s  Department of Economic Opportunity . \u201cSpeed matters\u201d when it comes to government assistance, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. Speed can mean the difference between a company\u2019s survival and its failure, or between making a home mortgage payment and facing foreclosure. There is \u201ca race between policy and a pandemic,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said, and in many places, it is clear that the response has been \u201cvery uneven.\u201d Using data reported by the Labor Department for March 14 to April 11, the  Economic Policy Institute,  a liberal research group, estimated that seven in 10 applicants were receiving benefits. That left seven million other jobless workers who had filed claims but were still waiting for relief. States manage their own unemployment insurance programs and set the level of benefits and eligibility rules. Now they are responsible for administering federal emergency benefits that provide payments for an additional 13 weeks, cover previously ineligible workers and add $600 to the regular weekly check. So far, 44 states have begun to send the $600 supplement to jobless workers who qualified under state rules, the Labor Department said. Only two \u2014 Kentucky and Minnesota \u2014 have extended federal benefits to workers who have used up their state allotment. With government phones and websites clogged and drop-in centers closed, legal aid lawyers around the country are fielding complaints from people who say they don\u2019t know where else to turn. \u201cOur office has received thousands of calls,\u201d said John Tirpak, a lawyer with the Unemployment Law Project, a nonprofit group in Washington. People with disabilities and nonnative English speakers have had particular problems, he said. Even those able to file initially say they have had trouble getting back into the system as required weekly to recertify their claims. Colin Harris of Marysville, Wash., got a letter on March 31 from the state\u2019s unemployment insurance office saying he was eligible for benefits after being laid off as a quality inspector at Safran Cabin, an aerospace company. He submitted claims two weeks in a row and heard nothing. When he submitted his next claim, he was told that he had been disqualified. He has tried calling more than 200 times since then, with no luck. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still where I am right now,\u201d he said, \u201cunable to talk to somebody to find out what the issue is.\u201d If he had not received a $1,200 stimulus check from the federal government, he said, he would not have been able to make his mortgage payment. Last week\u2019s tally of new claims was lower than each of the previous three weeks. But millions of additional claims are still expected to stream in from around the country over the next month, while hiring remains piddling. States are frantically trying to catch up. California, which has processed 2.7 million claims over the last four weeks, opened a second call center on Monday. New York, which has deployed 3,100 people to answer the telephone, said this week that it had reduced the backlog that accumulated by April 8 to 4,305 from 275,000. Florida had the largest increase in initial claims last week, although the state figures, unlike the national total, are not seasonally adjusted. That increase could be a sign that jobless workers finally got access to the system after delays, but it is impossible to assess how many potential applicants have still failed to get in. The 10 states that have started making Pandemic Unemployment Assistance payments to workers who would not normally qualify under state guidelines are Alabama, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. Pain is everywhere, but it is most widespread among the most vulnerable. In a  survey  that the Pew Research Center released on Tuesday, 52 percent of low-income households \u2014 below $37,500 a year for a family of three \u2014 said someone in the household had lost a job because of the coronavirus, compared with 32 percent of upper-income ones (with earnings over $112,600). Forty-two percent of families in the middle have been affected as well. Those without a college education have taken a disproportionate hit, as have Hispanics and African-Americans, the survey found. An outsize share of jobless claims have also been filed by women, according to an analysis from  the Fuller Project , a nonprofit journalism organization that focuses on women. Josalyn Taylor, 31, learned that she was out of a job on March 16. \u201cI clocked in at 3 o\u2019clock, and by 3:30 my boss called me and told me we were going to shut down for three weeks,\u201d said Ms. Taylor, an assistant manager at Cicis Pizza in Galveston, Tex. The restaurant has yet to reopen. Two days later, she applied for unemployment insurance, but she kept receiving a message that a claim was already active for her Social Security number and that she could not file. She has tried to clear up the matter hundreds of times \u2014 online, by phone and through the Texas Workforce Commission\u2019s site on Facebook \u2014 with no luck. \u201cI used my stimulus check to pay my light bill, and I\u2019m using that to keep groceries and stuff in the house,\u201d said Ms. Taylor, who is five months pregnant. \u201cBut other than that, I don\u2019t have any other income, and I\u2019m almost out of money.\u201d The first wave of layoffs most heavily whacked the restaurant, travel, personal care, retail and manufacturing industries, but the damage has spread to a much broader range of sectors. At the online job site Indeed, for example, postings for software development jobs are down nearly 30 percent from last year, while listings for finance and banking openings are down more than 40 percent. New layoffs are expected to ease over the next couple of months, but the damage to the economy is likely to last much longer. In a matter of weeks, the shutdown has more than erased 10 years of net job gains \u2014 more than 19 million jobs. Health and education are going to revive relatively quickly, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock, but leisure and hospitality are going to take a lot longer. \u201cA lot of the people who have been furloughed won\u2019t come back,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies will either close or decide not to take back those workers.\u201d Over the past decade, the employment landscape has shifted substantially as new types of jobs have appeared and old categories have disappeared. The U.S. economy, Mr. Rieder said, is \u201cgoing to go through another period of evolution.\u201d Tara Siegel Bernard contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Coronavirus: Should we all be wearing face masks now? - BBC News",
    "text": "Advice on whether the public should wear face masks has been passed on to the UK government by its scientific advisers. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) looked at issues like protecting the supply of medical face masks, and the public covering their faces with scarves or homemade masks. The World Health Organization (WHO)  says only two groups of people should wear protective masks, those who are: It says medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers. Masks are not recommended for the general public because:  The  European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  agrees that medical face masks should be prioritised for healthcare workers. But it says non-surgical face masks might help stop the spread of coronavirus by people who are contagious but have no symptoms.  This might be particularly useful in busy spaces, such as grocery stores, shopping centres, and on public transport, it says. Coronavirus is spread by droplets that can spray into the air when those infected talk, cough and sneeze. These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object. The UK government is not currently advising most people to wear masks, but has said it will consider what its scientific advisers say. However, the cabinet did not discuss the subject at its meeting on Thursday morning. At the weekend, more than 100 doctors wrote a letter to The Times saying they were \"alarmed at official inaction over the need for the public to wear homemade face masks\". They said it was \"illogical\" to advise people to wear masks if they are showing symptoms, but not if they appear symptom-free. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has urged people to use non-medical face coverings, such as a scarf or bandana, when social distancing is not possible. And while the WHO has not changed its advice, its special envoy Dr David Nabarro believes that \"some form of facial protection is going to become the norm\" across society.  The widespread use of face masks by the public could put NHS supplies at risk, says Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers. In hospitals, different types of mask offer different grades of protection. The most protective is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2.  NHS staff in  lower-risk situations  can wear a surgical mask. This includes healthcare workers within one metre of a patient with possible or confirmed Covid-19. These staff may be in hospitals, primary care, ambulance trusts, community care settings and care homes. Some masks are still available online, but it can be difficult to know how safe they are and prices are often high. Masks are out of stock in many High Street pharmacies as are those used for home improvements in many DIY stores. And Health Minister Matt Hancock has said that, unlike in France, the government cannot promise free masks for the general public if required. \"It would be an extraordinary undertaking,\" he said. If wearing homemade masks is recommended, there is lots of advice online about how to make them. Suggestions include using common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding. However, homemade masks are not regulated, whereas officially-made ones  have to meet safety requirements . Reusable cloth masks are not recommended  and may even increase the chance of infection, say European advisers.  This is because there is a high chance virus particles could go through cloth, and moisture in it could retain the virus, they warn. Other countries have brought in different rules around the wearing of face masks. They are to become compulsory on public transport  in Germany, and  in supermarkets and pharmacies in Austria. Residents in Lombardy in Italy  must cover their nose and mouth  when outside and the French government  plans to give out masks to the general public. Air passengers in Canada  must wear a non-medical mask or a face covering,  and in the USA,  people are advised to wear  \"cloth face coverings\" in supermarkets and pharmacies. Gloves and other protective wear are recommended for NHS staff working in places where they could encounter coronavirus.  Again, staff in the highest-risk scenarios  are advised to wear fuller protection,  rather than a simple apron, gloves, mask and goggles. The general public are not advised to wear gloves or any other protective gear.  To protect yourself from coronavirus, the NHS recommends regular and through hand washing, covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and not touching your face with unwashed hands.",

    "title": "Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself? - BBC News",
    "text": "Coronavirus has claimed more than 156,000 lives and infected nearly 2.3 million people around the world.  Among them is UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is now recuperating  after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Coronavirus infects the lungs. The two main symptoms are a fever or a dry cough, which can sometimes lead to breathing problems. The cough to look out for is a new, continuous cough. This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. If you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual. You have a fever if your temperature is above 37.8C. This can make you feel warm, cold or shivery.  A sore throat, headache and diarrhoea have also been reported and  a loss of smell and taste may also be a symptom. It takes  five days on average to start showing the symptoms,  but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the incubation period lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK,  the NHS 111 website  will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units (ICUs) are specialist wards for people who are very ill.  Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask, or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat. Patients with mild symptoms should  self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are  advised not to ring NHS 111  to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.  Details for Scotland are to  check NHS inform,  then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland,  call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected,  you may be told to self-isolate. The  World Health Organization has also issued advice  for the public. The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable.  Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported. A World Health Organization (WHO) examination of  data from 56,000 patients  suggests: Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. Work to develop a vaccine is under way . The best thing is  regular and thorough hand washing,  preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.  So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick.   Face masks do not provide effective protection,  according to medical experts. However, the WHO is re-examining  whether the public might benefit from using them. Follow James  on Twitter.

    "title": "Atlanta teen allegedly killed by stepfather for not sheltering in place, police say - CNN",
    "text": "Atlanta (CNN) It began as a fight over a  stay-at-home directive . By the end, a teenage boy was dead. Atlanta police say they responded to a call of a person shot just after 8 p.m. Wednesday. When they arrived, they found 16-year-old De'onte Roberts gravely wounded.  He had been shot in the chest during a domestic dispute with his stepfather, 42-year-old Bernie Hargrove, Atlanta Police Department spokesman Steve Avery told CNN. Roberts was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, where he died from his injuries. According to a statement police shared with CNN, the dispute began earlier in the day, when Roberts refused his parents' order to remain at home and comply with recent shelter-in-place directives, his mother told detectives. When Roberts returned home and kicked in the door to the house, a physical fight began between Roberts and Hargrove, the mother told detectives. Roberts was shot during that altercation, the statement said. Homicide detectives interviewed Hargrove and charged him with felony murder, according to a police statement. Tracy Flanagan, public affairs officer with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, told CNN that Hargrove had a first appearance hearing Thursday morning and bond was denied. He is being held in the Fulton County Jail. CNN's attempts to contact Hargrove's attorney were unsuccessful. Georgia was one of the  later states to implement shelter-in-place  orders due to the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Monday, Gov. Brian Kemp announced his plans to  allow certain businesses such as fitness centers, bowling alleys and hair salons  to reopen on Friday. Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, has recorded 2,436 cases of the virus  with 88 deaths  as of Thursday, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.",

    "title": "They won the war against coronavirus. Here's what life looks like on the other side - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) Cookie Villarreal was finally home. She had beaten the novel coronavirus but she couldn't get dressed by herself or even raise her arms to brush her hair. \"By the grace of God I was able to get off (the ventilator),\" said the 69-year-old woman from Lorain, Ohio. Villarreal is among thousands of people who have survived after contracting Covid-19. As of Thursday, estimates indicate that more than 710,000 people have recovered from Covid-19 worldwide, according to data collected by  John Hopkins University.  The actual figure is likely to be higher because the data cover only confirmed cases. The survivors are old and young,  celebrities , health care workers, faith leaders and parents. They battled the virus while hospitalized or isolated at home and were able to make it through. Here's what people on the other side of the pandemic are doing: They are learning how to breathe and walk again Jesse Vanderhoof could barely move with a walker around his home in Blaine County, Idaho, and going to his upstairs bedroom was out of the question. For the 40-year-old nurse, the skiing and hiking trips with his wife feel like distant memories. Ten days after leaving the hospital, walking only a couple of blocks leaves him extremely exhausted.  \"You want to talk about humbling and challenging for a man, that's as tough as it gets right there,\" Vanderhoof said of his week on a ventilator after he contracted coronavirus while working on Covid-19 testing tents. Vanderhoof's wife, Emily, said she's slept on the floor while he slept on the couch to help him walk to the bathroom at night and has seen him battle the \" ICU delirium ,\" an acute brain condition particularly common in patients who are sedated and on a ventilator for extended periods of time. \"He didn't understand why the world was at war with (Covid-19), why health care workers were heroes, why he was involved,\" Emily, 34, said. \"We had the same conversation for four days straight.\" Some survivors, such as David Lat, say one of their biggest challenges has been learning \"how to breathe again\" after spending 17 days in a New York hospital and six days on a ventilator.  \"It's not happily ever after, but it's better than the alternative,\" the lawyer and founder of the blog  \"Above the Law \" told CNN. The ventilator may have caused some damage to his vocal chords, Lat says, noting his hoarse voice, but \"I wouldn't be here without it.\" Leah Blomberg's muscles are weak after being in a medically-induced coma and on a ventilator for nine days. She says she feels lucky to be alive, but what used to be a 15-minute shower now takes her 45 minutes. \"The recovery is probably the worst,\" Blomberg said. \"Basically it's having to learn to walk again, because your muscles ... it's like you've never used them before.\" For those who were not hospitalized, the recovery at home can vary. Some say the process is not immediate and it has taken them weeks to recover their stamina, while others say it takes from days to weeks to get past the fever. They are reuniting with their families  When Sandra Sandoli embraced her husband and daughters, it was a hug like no other. It was their own Easter Sunday miracle. \"I cried. It was a hug of relief and happiness but also of sadness for all we are all going through now. So many emotions at once,\" said Sandoli, 52, a retired teacher in Fair Haven, New Jersey.  For more than a month, Sandoli was quarantined in her bedroom after falling ill while visiting her parents in Delaware and testing positive for Covid-19. She couldn't see her parents, who contracted the virus through her, or comfort her two daughters who flew home from college. They would leave her meals and tea by the door and pick up the empty dishes, wearing a mask and gloves, by the end of the day. They'd talk over the phone with her or while standing in different rooms. Sandoli overcame the fever and regained her strength but a lingering cough worried her. Afraid of the virus and unable to get tested again, Sandoli said she and her doctor decided she would wait indefinitely until the cough was gone. Sandoli left her bedroom Sunday and reunited with her family. They walked side by side for a few miles. \"It felt a little surreal,\" she said. \"The simplest thing like taking a walk was the biggest deal.\" They cooked and sat together at their dinner table eating fish, mashed potatoes and vegetables. They took a Zumba class online together. \"When I hugged my daughters, I didn't want it to end. I will never take those hugs for granted,\" Sandoli added. \"We made it.\" They are actively helping others  Nicole Chayet and her husband have been knocking on stranger's doors around New York and bringing them bags full of groceries and essentials for the past week.  \"I want to help others. I survived the virus and I feel strong,\" Chayet, 33, told CNN. \"I'm not afraid of going outside to help other people.\" When Chayet, director of media relations for the New York City Football Club, and her husband were ill, she said she was afraid of telling other people or even asking others to take care of their 22-month-old daughter while they recovered. Now, they are splitting their time between working from home, connecting with people suffering from coronavirus or their relatives, and trying to help others. Earlier this week, Chayet gave a blood sample to a study conducted by Mount Sinai Hospital, aiming to use antibodies to treat coronavirus patients. She said she wants to volunteer in more studies and has since received messages from people in states as far away as Arizona and California asking whether she could find a way to help their loved ones. Other survivors are mobilizing, donating blood or planning to help as soon as they make a full recovery. Diana Berrent, a photographer in Port Washington, New York, who recovered from Covid-19, created  Survivor Corps , a Facebook group aimed at helping people post and find research and donation opportunities for survivors. The group now has more than 30,000 members.   \"I'd like to think of it as a superhero -- me and all the other survivors have these internally-built hazmat suits,\" Berrent told CNN. Even Vanderhoof, the nurse in Idaho who is still slowly trying to regain his stamina, is looking forward to getting back to work -- even if he doesn't know when that would be possible. \"If I've learned anything in this experience with medical problems, it's that I want to help people more than I ever have before,\" Vanderhoof said.  What has been one of his most vulnerable times has become motivation for Vanderhoof to keep living and ultimately defend others from the pandemic.",

    "title": "Coronavirus Live Updates: House Passes $484 Billion Aid Package - The New York Times",
    "text": "transcript On this vote, the yeas are 388, the nays are 5, with 1 present. The bill is passed. We will fight this virus together until we defeat it together. We did not ask for this virus. We did not invite it. It came from a distant land, but together we will defeat it. We want to put people before politics. Our entire effort will be bipartisan. After all, public health and a strong economy are not a Democrat or Republican issue. Today was an historic day for us to once again pass our now-fourth bipartisan legislation to address the coronavirus crisis. We\u2019re very pleased with the vote, 388 to 5. They saw the light that we could do much more for small businesses. So $60 billion in a set-aside for, shall we say, the underbanked: the women, minorities veterans, Native Americans, rural folks \u2014\u00a0people who didn\u2019t have big banking relationships but had big credit needs. Another $60 billion in loans and grants for small businesses \u2014 all of small businesses. And then $100 billion \u2014 $100 billion \u2014 for hospitals and testing. Quite a remarkable feat. The House on Thursday gave resounding approval to a $484 billion coronavirus relief package to restart a depleted loan program for  distressed small businesses  and provide funds for hospitals and coronavirus testing, and moved to increase oversight of the sprawling federal response to the pandemic.  President Trump said he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the action to refill the loan program and indicated he would sign the measure as early as Thursday evening. It was the latest installment in a government aid program that is approaching $3 trillion, which passed with broad bipartisan support even as some Democrats condemned it for being too stingy. But the fight over what should be included foreshadowed a pitched partisan battle to come over  the next round of federal relief , which is likely to center on aid to states and cities facing dire financial straits. Even as they dispensed with another nearly half-trillion taxpayer dollars, Democrats were moving to scrutinize the administration\u2019s handling of the funds. Just before the aid package passed, they pushed through a measure creating a special committee to investigate the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic and the array of federal spending measures enacted to address it, defying objections from Mr. Trump and Republicans.  The committee, which will have the power to subpoena documents and witnesses, is charged with examining how the coronavirus relief packages were rolled out, and scrutinizing \u201cpreparedness for and response to the coronavirus crisis.\u201d  The package passed on Thursday was an interim step after enactment of the $2.2 trillion stimulus law. It emerged after a flurry of negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration after funding lapsed for the Paycheck Protection Program, a small-business loan program created by the stimulus plan that had been overwhelmed by demand as soon as it began.  The measure replenished that program, providing $320 billion for it, but at the insistence of Democrats who demanded additional funds and policy changes, it also included $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing \u2014 plus a mandate that the Trump administration come up with a strategy for helping states deploy and access tests across the country. The vote took place in a House chamber transformed by the pandemic. It was an impassioned debate as lawmakers, most of whom covered their faces with blue surgical masks or homemade swaths of fabric in an array of colors, patterns and glitter, reflected on the effect of the pandemic on their individual districts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi donned purple latex gloves to cast a vote.  Multiple lawmakers who had previously had to isolate outside of Washington after testing positive or being exposed to Covid-19 returned to vote. Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, her voice cracking with emotion, said that she dedicated the bill to her sister, who was dying of the disease in a St. Louis hospital.  Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has said the measure was far too small and should include aid to struggling states and cities, was the sole Democrat who opposed the bill. Four Republicans voted \u201cno,\u201d while Representative Justin Amash, the chamber\u2019s lone independent, voted present.  During the Great Recession, tax collections fell so steeply that state and local governments furloughed and laid off police officers and cut aid to key services like health care, transportation and schools. Some cities turned off streetlights to save on electricity, and Hawaii cut its school aid so much that  it closed them down altogether on many Fridays . The current downturn is shaping up to be worse, and  bipartisan groups of governors  and  mayors  from around the country have been pleading with Washington for aid to help them keep workers on their payrolls as they grapple with a growing public health and economic crisis. But Congress did not provide money for state governments in the  $484 billion aid package  passed by the House on Thursday, after Democrats failed to persuade Republicans to do so, setting up the next political battle over pandemic relief. (States, territories and tribal areas were allocated $150 billion in previous pandemic legislation.) Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader,  alarmed and angered state officials  on Wednesday when he said he wanted to approach the next round of pandemic legislation more deliberately. He said he was opposed to shipping money to state governments if they were going to apply it to fiscal problems unrelated to the pandemic, such as shoring up underfunded pension plans for public workers. Rather than looking for handouts, Mr. McConnell said, states should consider filing for bankruptcy. His aides threw fuel on the fire in a news release that said the Senate leader was opposed to \u201cblue state bailouts,\u201d suggesting it was Democratic-leaning states that were seeking the money to take care of problems caused by fiscal mismanagement. Mr. Trump gave ambivalent signals about further aid to state governments at his White House briefing on Thursday, suggesting that he might be open to offering it but also echoing Mr. McConnell\u2019s language, which had outraged Democratic governors like Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. \u201cIt is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Cuomo accused Mr. McConnell of hyperpartisanship, calling the \u201cblue state bailout\u201d label \u201cvicious.\u201d \u201cHow ugly a thought,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of what he is saying. People died \u2014 15,000 people died in New York, but they were predominantly Democrats, so why should we help them?\u201d The National Governors Association, a bipartisan group of governors, wrote federal officials this week pleading for $500 billion to help them make up for lost tax revenues during what they called \u201cthe most dramatic contraction of the U.S. economy since World War II.\u201d The group\u2019s chairman, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, told  Politico  on Thursday that he thought Mr. McConnell would come to regret his remarks. \u201cThe last thing we need in the middle of an economic crisis,\u201d he said, \u201cis to have the states all filing bankruptcy all across America and not able to provide services to people who desperately need them.\u201d  Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, a Democrat, was blunter: In an appearance Thursday  on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d  he called Mr. McConnell\u2019s comments \u201cnuts.\u201d In January, a mystery illness swept through a call center in a skyscraper in Chicago. Close to 30 people in one department alone had symptoms \u2014 dry, deep coughs and fevers they could not shake. When they gradually returned to work after taking sick days, they sat in their cubicles looking wan and tired. \u201cI\u2019ve started to think it was the coronavirus,\u201d said Julie Parks, a 63-year-old employee who was among the sick. \u201cI may have had it, but I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d The revelation this week that a death in the United States in early February was  the result of the coronavirus  has significantly altered the understanding of how early the virus may have been circulating in this country. Researchers now believe that  hidden outbreaks were creeping through cities  like Chicago, New York, Seattle and Boston in January and February, weeks earlier than previously known. The new timeline has lent credence to a question on the minds of many Americans: Did I already have the coronavirus? The retroactive search is happening on many levels. People who had suffered dreadful bouts with flulike illnesses are now wondering if it was the coronavirus. Doctors are thinking back to unexplained cases. Medical examiners are poring over their records looking for possible misdiagnosed deaths. And local politicians are demanding investigations. \u201cI think it was here long before we knew it,\u201d said Brian Gustafson, a coroner in Rock Island County, Ill. \u201cThat\u2019s the only logical thing I can think of.\u201d Included in Mr. Gustafson\u2019s suspicions of an undercount: himself. transcript Yesterday was the deadliest day for this virus in the state \u2014 115 human beings lost their lives. Families torn apart. It was the deadliest day in the state of California. Hospitalizations down 0.4 percent and 1.2 percent decline in I.C.U.s. But what happened was also significant \u2014 what was also \u2014 a number of what we call P.U.I.s: These are persons under investigation, and both for hospitalizations and for I.C.U.s. We saw those persons under investigation drop as well. So all four of those categories dropped. We\u2019re walking into a very warm weekend. The most beautiful weekend, to the extent you love warm weather, since January, at least since arguably last summer in the state of California. That means people are prone to want to go to the beaches, parks, playgrounds and go on a hike. And I anticipate there\u2019ll be a significant increase in volume. But I also think if there is, and people aren\u2019t practicing physical distancing, I\u2019ll be announcing in a week or so these numbers going back up. I don\u2019t think anybody wants to hear that. I don\u2019t want to share that information. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Thursday that the state had experienced its \u201cdeadliest day\u201d since the start of the pandemic, with 115 coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health  reported 68 new deaths  on Thursday.  \u201cCovid-19 is rapidly becoming one of the leading causes of death among L.A. County residents,\u201d Barbara Ferrer, the county\u2019s director of public health, said in a statement. According to  The New York Times\u2019s tracking , there have been about 1,500 deaths and 38,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state.  Nonetheless, the White House remains resolutely upbeat. \u201cHonestly, if you look at the trends today, I think by Memorial Day weekend we will largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence predicted on Thursday  on Geraldo Rivera\u2019s Cleveland radio show . \u201cWe\u2019re getting there, America,\u201d Mr. Pence said at the nightly White House news conference. The California governor was more somber. While Mr. Newsom noted that hospitalizations and patients in intensive care had decreased slightly from the day before, he said the number of deaths should serve as a warning that even as the weather warms \u2014 tempting Californians to flock to beaches or gather outdoors \u2014 the virus remains an insidious force.  \u201cLet\u2019s not dream of regretting,\u201d he said. \u201cStay home to the extent possible.\u201d He also urged patience for local leaders and other Californians who had asked when the state would ease orders to stay at home. The state will first need to significantly ramp up testing capacity. Legions of  contact tracers  are being trained to help track and halt any outbreaks. Still, Mr. Newsom on Wednesday announced a first modest step in that direction: Hospitals would again be scheduling what are called elective procedures, which can include medically necessary procedures like tumor removals. Nearly a month after Washington rushed through an emergency package to aid jobless Americans, millions of laid-off workers have still not been able to apply for those benefits \u2014 let alone receive them \u2014 because of overwhelmed state unemployment systems. Across the country, states have frantically scrambled to handle a flood of applications and apply a new set of federal rules even as more and more people line up for help. On Thursday, the  Labor Department reported  that another 4.4 million people filed initial unemployment claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million. Nearly one in six American workers has lost a job in recent weeks. \u201cAt all levels, it\u2019s eye-watering numbers,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. Laid-off workers need money quickly so that they can continue to pay rent and credit card bills and buy groceries, he noted. Yet according to the Labor Department, only 10 states have started making payments under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which extends coverage to freelancers, self-employed workers and part-timers. Most states have not even completed the system needed to start the process. States manage their own unemployment insurance programs and set the level of benefits and eligibility rules. Now they are responsible for administering federal emergency benefits that provide payments for an additional 13 weeks, cover previously ineligible workers and add $600 to the regular weekly check. In Florida, hundreds of thousands of unemployed people have been waiting for weeks for a check. It has taken some as long as that to file. As Florida\u2019s unemployment website became unusable under the weight of the traffic, the state agreed this month to accept paper applications, a tacit acknowledgment that the system was all but broken. Florida\u2019s breakdown became a national symbol of distress, when footage of  a snaking line  for those applications outside the public library in Hialeah, a blue-collar city outside Miami, drew wide attention online. The debacle has become an embarrassment for  Gov. Ron DeSantis , a Republican. He called the system \u201ccumbersome\u201d last week and acknowledged that only 4 percent of 850,000 pending claims had been paid. He appointed an unemployment czar and signed executive orders waiving some requirements to ease the traffic on the website. The number of paid claims has slowly inched up. \u201cFlorida is a terrible state to be an unemployed person,\u201d said Michele Evermore, an unemployment insurance expert at the National Employment Law Project in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get in. Once you do it\u2019s easy to get disqualified. The benefit level is way below average. And that was before the crisis.\u201d People on unemployment in most states normally receive, on average, less than half their weekly salaries. Now many are poised to receive more than they would have normally earned in their jobs. Flight attendants on United Airlines flights will be required to cover their faces while on duty starting Friday, the airline said. \u201cWe have added masks on all flights to ensure flight attendants have one mask each per duty day,\u201d United said in a letter to flight attendants on Thursday. \u201cWe will replenish as needed and as supplies permit, and, while we worked hard to make sure we have enough supply to provide each of you, you also may wear your own cloth mask.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic has  decimated commercial air travel , leaving major carriers scrambling to stay afloat after  consumer demand plummeted . In a  securities filing  on Wednesday, United said it has cut about 80 percent of its capacity this month and expects to cut 90 percent of its capacity in May. Major carriers including United, Delta, American and Southwest Airlines have aggressively advertised the precautions they are taking to lure back passengers, from restricting food service to blocking out middle seats. While United said masks would be required for flight attendants, they were merely recommended for other employees, like pilots and airport crews. United said it was the first major carrier in the United States to require masks for all flight attendants. Frontier Airlines has had a policy requiring masks for all crew members in place for more than a week, and major carriers including Delta, American and Southwest Airlines said they have made masks available to their flight attendants. The Association of Flight Attendants, a union that represents flight attendants at more than a dozen airlines in the United States, applauded the move by United, and said in a  letter  to federal officials on Thursday that everyone on commercial flights and in airports \u2014 including passengers \u2014 should be required to wear masks.  transcript So we have undertaken the largest, most comprehensive study of New York State to find out what is the infection rate. And that we started a few days ago. Sample size, so far, 3,000 people statewide. Let\u2019s find out what the infection rate is. We have preliminary data on Phase 1, and this is going to be ongoing. We did about 3,000 tests. But what we found so far is the statewide number is 13.9 percent tested positive for having the antibodies. What does that mean? It means these are people who were infected, and who developed the antibodies to fight the infection. Long island at 16.7, New York City at 21.2 Westchester/Rockland, 11.7 and rest of state, 3.6. This basically quantifies what we\u2019ve been seeing anecdotally, and what we have known, but it puts numbers to it. It changes the theories of what the death rate is. If you get infected, 13 percent of the population is about 2.7 million people who have been infected. If you look at what we have now as a death total, which is 15,500, that would be about 0.5 percent death rate. About 21 percent of about 1,300 people in New York City  who were screened for virus antibodies tested positive , Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said on Thursday. The results come from a state program that randomly tested 3,000 supermarket customers across New York State this week. Nearly 14 percent of those tests came back positive, he said.  If those numbers translate to the true incidence of the virus, they would mean that more than 1.7 million people in New York City, and more than 2.4 million people statewide, have already been infected. These numbers are far greater than the 250,000 confirmed cases of the virus that the state has recorded. Hours before Mr. Cuomo\u2019s presentation, a top New York City health official cautioned against making too much of  the usefulness of the test results  in making critical decisions about social distancing and reopening the economy, particularly in identifying immunity. The official said the tests \u201cmay produce false negative or false positive results.\u201d By the time New York City confirmed its first case on March 1, thousands of infections were already silently spreading through the city,  according to a model of the disease  by researchers at Northeastern University. Georgia\u2019s Republican governor on Thursday appeared undeterred by a torrent of resistance, led by President Trump, to his plan to allow many businesses to reopen this week. Less than 24 hours after Mr. Trump said he opposed Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s strategy, saying that he thought he was acting \u201ctoo soon,\u201d Mr. Kemp used his Twitter account  to publicize a list  of frequently asked questions about how Georgia intended to relax its rules.  He gave no indication that he intended to reverse his decision, announced on Monday, for what he described as a measured process meant to bolster the economy. The governor\u2019s plan gives permission to gyms, hair and nail salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors to reopen on Friday. Then, on Monday, restaurants are allowed to resume dine-in service, and movie theaters and other entertainment venues can reopen. Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Kemp even more strongly on Thursday evening. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with Brian Kemp,\u201d he said at the White House briefing, adding that while he had told Mr. Kemp to do what he thought was necessary, he believed that the governor\u2019s plan to reopen Georgia\u2019s businesses did not follow the federal guidelines that his administration detailed last week.  \u201cI don\u2019t want this thing to flare up because you are deciding to do something that is not in the guidelines,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Kemp\u2019s decision on reopening  was immediately assailed , as public health experts, the mayors of Georgia\u2019s largest cities and others warned that it stood to have perilous consequences. Business owners who were otherwise eager to revive their livelihoods said they would hold off.  The  death toll in Georgia stood at 872 on Thursday,  having risen by more than 100 since Mr. Kemp announced his reopening plans on Monday. And the state has now confirmed 21,512 cases, the Georgia Department of Public Health reported, up from 18,947 on Monday. Mr. Trump\u2019s head-spinning criticism of Mr. Kemp\u2019s plan has sown confusion among Georgia Republicans, who saw Mr. Kemp, a full-throated Trump fan, win the governorship in 2018 on the strength of a presidential endorsement. It has also  sent a confusing message to other governors  who are confronting politically fraught decisions over whether they should loosen their own restrictions in the coming days. On Thursday, Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, which borders Georgia, said he would extend his state\u2019s stay-at-home order until May 8, saying  on Twitter , \u201cwe need to slow the virus before we can ease restrictions.\u201d A detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county. The Navy said Thursday that it had completed virus testing on all 4,938 crew members of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, with 840 people, or 17 percent, testing positive. The Navy announcement comes as top Pentagon leaders are preparing to unveil a report on the handling of the virus on the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which led to  the removal of the ship\u2019s captain , Brett E. Crozier, and the eventual resignation of the acting Navy secretary. The crisis aboard the Roosevelt gripped the Navy in recent weeks. Of the total cases, 88 sailors have recovered and 4,234 have moved ashore, the Navy said. Four sailors are in the hospital with the virus. The ship is docked in Guam. You may be wondering how to cut some expenses right now. One way is to figure out who owes you money from the many services you pay for but aren\u2019t in business right now. Think day camps, gyms and airlines. But when is it fair to ask for your money back? Here are some guidelines to help.

    "title": "UPS drivers: 'We're getting flat out hammered right now' - CNN",
    "text": "Washington, DC (CNN) At UPS, the most frantic time of year is typically around the winter holidays. Then   things level off. But these days, as the coronavirus pandemic spurs American households and businesses to buy almost everything online,   the deliveries have seemed relentless. Online sales data and anecdotal evidence from employees we spoke to show the volume of packages handled has significantly increased. That has many  UPS   ( UPS )  workers putting in long, physically exhausting hours while, at the same time, taking extra precautions to protect themselves from infection. \"I'm working more than I ever have in almost 24 years at UPS,\" Jack Warren, a UPS delivery driver based out of Providence, Rhode Island, tells CNN. Warren is also a union steward and is in charge of the safety committee at his facility. He says the team spends extra time cleaning \"handrails, doorknobs, some of the machinery,\" including the trucks and forklifts. Drivers, who walk into dozens of public spaces a day, also carry paper towels and cleaning spray, he said. At UPS's  massive Worldport facility  in Louisville, Kentucky, which processes roughly 2 million packages a day, two employees have died from   Covid-19, according to Teamsters Local 89, which represents workers at Worldport, and a Clarke County, Indiana health official.   It's unclear where the workers contracted the virus ,  the company said. \"COVID-19 is a community-spread virus. There is no way to know how/where someone contracted it,\" wrote UPS spokesman Jim Mayer in an email to CNN.  The company won't confirm how many workers have gotten sick, he added. The company has put several measures in place to keep workers safe.   UPS began distributing masks and personal protective equipment to workers in early April, Mayer said. To encourage social distancing, he said, the company has also   added markings at six-foot intervals in areas where employees are likely to gather.   At Worldport, it has rented school buses so workers can spread out while on company shuttles, Mayer said.  UPS said it is also   offering two weeks   of paid sick leave to workers who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed under a quarantine. But some workers say more could be done: A Change.org petition  demanding hazard pay for UPS workers  has received nearly 240,000 signatures.   The company said it's not providing hazard pay at this time.  The coronavirus has impacted   the lives of many UPS delivery drivers, package handlers and their families. CNN spoke with some of them about their experiences. Here's what they had to say (these comments below have been edited for clarity). Jack Warren UPS delivery driver and union steward in Providence, Rhode Island I go in an hour early every day and oversee our safety committee. Every morning we make a new mixture of water and bleach and fill spray bottles. We spray parts of the building \u2014 handrails, doorknobs, some of the machinery. We've got 400 trucks that need to be sprayed twice a day. We even spray down the forklifts.  When I get back at night, I stay for another hour. I spray out probably 75 trucks myself at night. Guys always call me with concerns. Before this, I'd take 15 to 20 calls on a bad day. I take between 40 to 60 a day now. Every truck has a roll of paper towels and a spray bottle. I don't think guys have realized how many doorknobs and elevator buttons we touch. Some guys go in over 200 places a day. Brian Lee UPS delivery driver in Seattle We're getting flat out hammered right now.   No one wants to go to the store, everyone buys everything online. I'm working 60 hours a week. The kids are in bed when I leave for work and most nights they're in bed when I get home from work. I get home and I'm dead tired and I want to eat, take a shower and go to bed. My wife definitely pays a price. She's tasked with trying to keep our kids going with online schooling. She doesn't get a break and she pretty much doesn't get to leave the house because she's not supposed to. And obviously my kids don't get to spend time with their dad during the week. I've probably received more \"oh thank you so much for all you're doing,\" probably more the last two weeks than I have in the last 10 Christmases combined. That's typically when people notice how hard we're working. Olyjawan Ford UPS package handler in Lexington, Kentucky I'm concerned every day. The disease can be on the boxes. We don't know who touched them, sneezed on them, coughed on them. There's all the people that are in the warehouse working. In my house, we have four jobs \u2014 my girlfriend has two and I have two. Three of those jobs all shut down. It's just UPS right now. I like UPS, it's a good job. I had to do something to bring in some money. In the beginning when this all started, I didn't feel they were [doing enough to protect us]. They weren't giving us gloves or anything like that. No masks, no hand sanitizer. Now they are. (UPS began handing out masks and other protective gear to workers in early April after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  issued new guidance .) It was a debate that I had with myself, [to keep working and face the risks]. I thought about the unemployment. I don't make a lot of money at UPS. But I put together that my unemployment wouldn't be that much. It would probably be good for me just to keep working. Sawyer Redden UPS, first-aid responder and package loader in Louisville, Kentucky  I'm the person on call when   someone gets injured or has an asthma attack or something.   It's possible if someone had   Covid at UPS's Worldport facility, I'd be called to see them.  But I've had to stop doing [the first-aid response work]   because I live with two immune-compromised people. I struggle with the decision honestly. I do worry that, because I'm not on call, there's less people available to help. I still load packages to pay for college...If I didn't have the school debt I probably would've quit. My mother is constantly stressed about this. I hope she takes comfort in the   dozens of things I'm trying to do to limit this risk. She can see   my shoes outside on the porch, the rubbing alcohol I keep on the side table for my hands. She can hear the dryer every morning as I wash my clothes.  I tell her that somebody has to do this. Someone has to go into the line of fire. If we're being honest with each other, there's no way this is going to stop. There's no way that UPS is going to wake up tomorrow and say 'You know we're putting a bunch of people in danger. We can't reasonably do this anymore. Shut the whole place down.'  That would destroy the economy.  Brittany Rhynard  Her fiance is a UPS delivery truck driver in Lexington, Kentucky We see the stress they deal with. When they come home we see it on their faces. We know that they've had a hard day. What they're dealing with is what they deal with around the holidays, when people are ordering a lot of stuff online for Christmas.  I was trying to find gloves to pack in his lunch bag and I personally gave him like a spray bottle with a bleach cleaner and hand sanitizer and stuff to make sure he was somewhat protected. We got into it one day because he was getting ready to come into the house with his shoes and stripping down his uniform and putting it over a dining room chair and I was like, \"hold up.\" It makes us paranoid that they have been on the front line and could potentially bring it home. I'm worried about him. He's young, but he could get it. I make him take his boots off outside. He goes in so many public places throughout the day. I have a towel for him to sit them on and I spray them down with a Clorox cleaner every night. It's made me feel a little crazy, but I feel like during these times they have to be, just to be cautious to make sure we aren't bringing those germs in the home. I want people to understand when they do order something that is massive and heavy, just to give them something to do during this time, they need to find a way to say thank you to the person that's delivering it. It's not easy. I get emotional thinking about it, because I see it.",

    "title": "Coronavirus spread 'under the radar' in US major cities since January, researchers say - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) The novel  coronavirus  silently spread in the United States earlier than previously thought, infecting tens of thousands of people in New York and other major cities, researchers say. A new model by the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston shows the first infections came from China in early or mid-January, and that the virus went undetected because many people were not presenting symptoms. \"The disease spread under the radar,\" Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute,  said on \"CNN Newsroom\" on Thursday . The model suggests that while Americans were still focused on China, about 28,000 people in major cities -- such as New York, San Francisco and Seattle -- were infected by March 1. The virus circulated in the community of Santa Clara County, California about three weeks before the  first known US coronavirus-related death  in Washington state, Dr. Sara Cody, the county's public health director, told Anderson Cooper on Thursday. Earlier this week, Santa Clara County officials announced that tissue samples confirmed  two people who died in early February  tested positive for coronavirus.   That month, a number of physicians saw patients, without travel histories, who had flu-like symptoms.  But \"all indicators had suggested that it was a very low risk (for coronavirus),\" Cody said. Now, however, Cody said it's obvious \"the virus was circulating perhaps fairly widely in our county.\" Several states, including California and Indiana, have been retracing their  coronavirus  timelines after discovering that the highly infectious disease  started killing people  earlier than previously known. These discoveries have emphasized just how much about this pandemic remains uncertain and unknown. Four months since the novel coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, experts worldwide still do not fully understand  how the virus started ,  how it impacts the body  or  what treatments are effective .  US has enough tests for initial phase of reopening, FDA commissioner says Stephen Hahn, commissioner for the US Food and Drug Administration, said there are enough tests in the US for states looking to reopen under phase one of President Donald Trump's guidelines for reopening plan for the country. Hahn, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said tests that typically take years to develop are being created in weeks. His agency recently approved 62 diagnostic tests, including four antibody tests.  \"We are confident that we have enough tests for phase one of the reopening America plan but we do acknowledge the fact that we need to keep the pressure on developing more tests, getting more tests out there,\" Hahn told Anderson Cooper on Thursday during CNN's coronavirus town hall. State officials have been calling for the federal government's help to fulfill testing shortages .  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Thursday   shortages are  limiting the country's ability to test more. \"I am not overly confident right now at all that we have what it takes to do that,\" Fauci said at a  Time 100 Talks  interview. \"We're getting better and better at it, as the weeks go by, but we are not in a situation where we say we're exactly where we want to be with regard to testing.\" Many more New Yorkers could have had the virus, study suggests A preliminary study of 3,000 New Yorkers found that 13.9% tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday. If those rates hold for the state's  19.5 million people , then about 2.7 million people in the state had the virus -- numbers that are multiple times higher than the official state counts. The tests were performed on 3,000 random adults who were outside of the home, he said, so it was not an entirely random sample. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University, said New York's antibody testing results could be good news, as it means that the virus's fatality rate may be lower than the official fatality rate. \"It tells us this virus is much more widespread than we thought,\" he said. \"The hospitalization rate may be much lower because the denominator (of people infected) is so much bigger. \"I think it's also in a way reassuring, meaning that we are developing some immunity to this. There are people that have mild illness that don't know they are sick, and those individuals may be part of how we move forward as we start to think about reopening certain parts of the country.\" Earlier spread than known California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked coroners to review California cases dating to December after autopsies  revealed two people  in the state died of coronavirus in early and mid-February -- up to three weeks before the   first known US death from the virus . \"We are doing the same across the state and in other counties as well to ultimately help guide a deeper understanding of when this pandemic really started to impact Californians directly,\" Newsom said Wednesday. In Indiana, too, officials are tracking cases going back to at least mid-February --- weeks before the state announced its first case in early March. As of Thursday, there were more than 873,000 cases in the United States and at least 49,000 people have died from the virus, according to a tally by  Johns Hopkins University.  Governors and mayors feud over reopening The decision to reopen even as coronavirus deaths linger and cases continue to increase is pitting governors against mayors across the country. In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp made the most aggressive move yet to get the state's economy humming by allowing businesses such as barbershops, nail salons, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen Friday. A day after criticizing Kemp's decision, President Donald Trump said Thursday he may extend social distancing guidelines beyond May 1 if he doesn't feel the country is in a safe place. \"We may go beyond that,\" Trump said during a White House coronavirus briefing when asked whether he might need to re-up the guidelines when they expire at the end of the month. The National Governors Association released its \"Roadmap to Recovery,\" a guide for governors that lays out 10 steps that need to be taken in order for states to reopen their economies. The report says that testing capacity remains \"inadequate\" and says states who fail to properly test and trace Covid-19 cases could have significant outbreaks. \"States that fail to do so, or without adequate test and trace capability in place, will only notice problems when individuals begin to crowd emergency departments and outbreaks among the most at risk are reported,\" the report says. At that point, it will be too late to avoid wider spread that could overwhelm the health care system, it says. Other states have begun to reopen but in slower steps. In neighboring South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster announced  certain stores  can reopen at 20% capacity along with beaches. Mayor Stephen Benjamin of Columbia accused him of using \"arbitrary dates\" instead of data to make his decisions.  \"When you should go back to business is when you have some true indicators over two weeks that show a deceleration of the pandemic,\" Benjamin said, referring to one of the White House's criteria for reopening state economies. \"We need more testing. We need more data, and then we can decide how we go back into business.\"  Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said the governor's reopening plan was \"a measured response\" that took safety and social distancing into account. \"It's not like he opened the barn door and everything flies out,\" Tecklenburg said Not so fast, experts warn states A coronavirus model routinely cited by the White House warns that no state should be opening before May 1.  South Carolina and Georgia should not open until June 5 and June 19, respectively, according to the model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.  Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned Kemp to be careful. \"Going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be, I would advise him, as a health official and a physician, not to do that,\" Fauci said.  Montana has the best forecast at May 1. The only other states that should open by May 10 are Alaska, Hawaii, North Carolina, Vermont and West Virginia,  the model says .   North Carolina is the only one of the six states with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.  About half the states in the country should remain closed until May 25 or later, according to the model. The reopening dates are based on an assumption that states will have aggressive testing, contact tracing, isolation and limits on the size of gatherings to prevent another wave of the virus. Millions of coronavirus tests are needed each week before US restrictions can be safely lifted,  economists and public health experts say.  \"We have estimated we need at least three times as much testing as we have right now,\" said Dr. Anish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Initiative. \"We have been flat for like three and a half weeks. We have made no progress.\"",

    "title": "Managing Coronavirus Fears - The New York Times",
    "text": "Covid-19, the invisible enemy now bearing down on 328.2 million Americans, is tailor-made to induce fear and anxiety, prompting both rational and irrational behavior and, if the emotional stress persists, perhaps causing long-lasting harm to health. We\u2019re staring down an alien virus our bodies have never before encountered and which we are currently unable to control. There is no vaccine yet available to prevent Covid-19 or drug proven effective to fight the illness, limiting our ability to protect ourselves. So we buy reams and reams of toilet paper because it\u2019s something we can do to give us a feeling of dominance over a force that threatens to overwhelm us. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a time in modern human history when every person is seriously worried about the same thing at the same time,\u201d said David Ropeik, a consultant on risk management and former instructor in risk communication at the Harvard School of Public Health. And there\u2019s never before been a ubiquitous threat that can be so instantly broadcast to a world of 7.8 billion people. \u201cWe\u2019re being inundated with a constant flow of scary information that overwhelms our ability to be dispassionate,\u201d said Mr. Ropeik, author of \u201cHow Risky Is It, Really? Why Our Fears Don\u2019t Always Match the Facts.\u201d \u201cOur brains are screaming to give the coronavirus more weight, challenging our ability to recognize that most people are actually at low risk.\u201d As with other calamities, it\u2019s the bad news that gets the most attention, not the apparent fact that most people who become infected develop no symptoms or only mild ones and recover fully within a week or so. Compounding a sense of doom for some people is their inability to evaluate risk and the fact that what is an acceptable risk for one person is intolerable to another. Following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, many people were afraid to fly and instead drove thousands of miles, incurring a far greater risk to life and limb yet instilling a feeling of control with their hands on the wheel and foot on the gas. \u201cA risk we choose seems less dangerous than a risk that is imposed on us,\u201d Mr. Ropeik observed. Not that it\u2019s inappropriate to feel anxious about the risk we all now face, especially if that distress reminds us to be diligent about social distancing, avoid physical contact with people who do not share our household, wash our hands often and well and keep them off our faces and out of our eyes. But while a certain amount of worrying can help motivate you to protect against possible exposure to the virus, compulsively reading or tuning in to the bad news about Covid-19 throughout the day is unlikely to enhance your emotional or physical well-being. There are important health reasons to tamp down excessive anxiety that can accompany this viral threat. We have a built-in physiological response to imminent danger called fight-or-flight. Hearts beat faster, blood pressure rises and breathing rate increases to help us escape the man-eating lion. Underlying these stress-induced changes are hormones like adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol that can cause trouble if they persist too long in our circulation. Sustained anxiety increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, digestive problems, clinical depression and, ironically, infectious diseases like Covid-19 by weakening the immune response to a viral infection. \u201cThe stress of Covid-19 is now acute, but if it persists long after April, which it likely will, it will take an enormous toll on world health,\u201d Mr. Ropeik said. Thus, in addition to heeding the recommended personal precautions to avoid an infection, people feeling unduly stressed about the pandemic might try to minimize the damage caused by unmitigated anxiety. A psychotherapist I know has advised his patients to limit their exposure to the news and discussions about Covid-19 to one hour a day and, if possible, in only one location, then use the rest of the day and other parts of the home for productive or pleasurable activities. You can bolster positive feelings by doing something good \u2014 for your neighbors, the essential workers in your community, or strangers now lacking adequate resources to care for themselves or their families. I\u2019ve gone through closets and bagged tons of clothing to give to those in need, and I\u2019ve contributed to a GoFundMe site that is raising money to provide meals for workers at the neighborhood hospital, which also helps support local restaurants now limited to takeout only. There are  similar donation sites  now throughout the world. You can also tackle long-neglected chores in and around home. Some ideas: Clean out the refrigerator or pantry, take the stove apart and wash everything down, repair torn clothing (including socks!), go through bookshelves and pack up books not worth keeping that you read long ago or that are now out of date. And pay attention to leaders like New York\u2019s Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, who has emphasized that the most critical step in countering the damage wrought by this novel virus is to flatten the curve of rising infections, both to keep from overwhelming our health care systems and to buy time to develop more effective strategies and, hopefully, therapies. Few people, it seems, understand exponential growth well enough to appreciate the devastation that can result from the current rate of infection. In any new location, the infection may smolder for a brief period and then suddenly explode and take everyone by surprise, said Paul Slovic, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and president of Decision Research, a group of scientists who study decision-making and risk. \u201cThen you regret not having acted sooner to contain the threat,\u201d he said. Dr. Slovic, author of \u201cThe Perception of Risk,\u201d explained exponential growth in an article he and Howard C. Kunreuther of the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center  wrote in Politico last month : If a single lily pad in a pond doubled each day, after 40 days only 1/256th of the pond would be covered, but by day 47 half the pond would be covered and one day later, lily pads would cover the entire pond. The failure to recognize the potential for an exponential increase in Covid-19 when it began in China resulted in a squandered opportunity to control its spread. In just 67 days there were 100,000 cases worldwide; 11 days later another 100,000 cases, and four days after that, yet another 100,000 cases. Drs. Slovic and Kunreuther likened the trajectory of Covid-19 to climate change, which has been gradually worsening for many decades. As with the virus, our failure to act early on has not flattened the curve and is likely to result in an explosive surge that will devastate huge populations, with no vaccine or drug able to alleviate the damage.",

    "title": "Treasury Clarifies Small-Business Loans as Fed Vows Transparency - The New York Times",
    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration moved on Thursday to ensure that large corporations with access to capital are not improperly taking emergency small-business loans and the Federal Reserve committed to greater immediate transparency about how its bailout funds are deployed, amid growing concerns about how hundreds of billions of dollars of economic relief money are being allocated. The actions came as Congress passed a $484 billion supplemental relief package to replenish an initial $349 billion program for small businesses, as well as providing more support for hospitals and expanding coronavirus testing capacity. The Paycheck Protection Program, which gives forgivable loans for small companies that keep workers on the payroll, has stirred controversy as big, well-connected companies received money before many smaller ones. With the government required to provide few details about those recipients, concern has increased that the Treasury Department is shrouding its programs in secrecy \u2014 and that the Fed, once its own trillion-dollar efforts are up and running, will do the same. On Thursday, the Treasury Department warned big publicly traded companies that they must prove they are in need of emergency small-business loans to keep their operations going and have no other option to receive financing or repay the funds. The department updated its \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d page about the Paycheck Protection Program to urge \u201clarge companies with adequate sources of liquidity\u201d to think twice before applying for small-business loans that are backed by the Small Business Administration. The Small Business Administration\u2019s $349 billion fund to support these loans ran out last week and is expected to be replenished this week with another $310 billion. Anger over the program\u2019s fairness has escalated as some big restaurant chains, including Shake Shack, received $10 million loans for their subsidiaries. The Treasury Department notes that by law, small-business loans are intended to be taken in cases when the money is \u201cnecessary to support the ongoing operations.\u201d It said that borrowers needed to certify that requirement in \u201cgood faith\u201d and take into account their ability to gain access to other sources of money, such as issuing stock or selling bonds. \u201cFor example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith,\u201d the department said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned businesses that they will be investigated and could face penalties if they improperly accept small-business money. He has urged businesses to return those funds. The guidance does not, however, force companies to return the money or accelerate repayments. It remains unclear how the Treasury Department or the Small Business Administration will pursue investigations of loans that were given to borrowers that should not have been eligible. For the loans to be fully forgiven, businesses are required to demonstrate to banks that they met requirements to maintain staffing levels for eight weeks. The documentation that they provide could be subject to audits by the Internal Revenue Service. The guidance released on Thursday said borrowers that repay loans in full by May 7 will be deemed by the Small Business Administration to have made their certifications in good faith, leaving them in good standing with the government. At least four public companies, Shake Shack, Kura Sushi USA, Ruth\u2019s Hospitality Group and ItWorks, have said that they have already given back the funds from the Paycheck Protection Program. Sweetgreen, which is privately held, also said it had returned its $10 million loan. The Fed, which is infusing even more money into the financial system through its various facilities, said on Thursday that it would publicly disclose the names of companies that benefited from several of its lending programs. The Fed said it would also release the amount borrowed and interest rate charged as well as overall costs, revenues and fees on programs backed by Congress\u2019s recent appropriations. The Fed Board will publish program reports on its website at least every 30 days, without blacking out the information. Congress has handed the Treasury Department $454 billion to support Fed lending facilities, which are meant to keep credit flowing through the financial system. Using that layer of taxpayer insurance, the Fed has announced programs that are meant to help midsize businesses, state governments, and large corporations. The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Mr. Mnuchin are required to regularly report to Congress on the programs, but it was unclear how much detail they would disclose publicly and in real time. \u201cThis is a significant victory for the public,\u201d Bharat Ramamurti, the first member of the Congressional Oversight Commission responsible for overseeing the Fed programs,  posted on Twitter after the release . \u201cYou will now know on a monthly basis which companies are getting support and how much support they\u2019re getting.\u201d The policy outlined on Thursday will apply to initiatives backed by new funding, according to the Fed. Those include two corporate bond-buying programs, a municipal bond-buying program and an effort to help midsize business. Those efforts are not underway. Programs meant to keep short-term markets functioning, which were announced and in some cases activated before the money was appropriated, will continue to report detailed information about participants on a delay. While the Fed must provide participant information to Congress while the programs are operating, the  Dodd-Frank law  only requires officials to make detailed disclosures public a year after the programs end. Fed officials have yet to decide which set of rules will apply to two of their programs \u2014 one that effectively buys bundles of consumer and business debt, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, and another that moves small business loans off bank balance sheets. Neither uses funding from the coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act. \u201cThis seems to me like the Fed trying to pre-empt some of the issues that really plagued them in and around the financial crisis,\u201d said Mark Spindel, who wrote a book about the Fed as a creature of Congress. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to be sensitive to the politics than to be open about who\u2019s getting\u201d the money.

    "title": "Goggles, Masks, Ponchos: Air Travel in the Days of the Coronavirus - The New York Times",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The thought of getting on a plane is far from most people\u2019s minds at the moment, as they shelter in their homes. But some people have no choice but to fly now, whether it is returning from a long trip or rushing to leave a country as a visa expires. In the days of the coronavirus, travelers are often taking extreme precautions to protect themselves. They wear anything from plastic ponchos to laboratory goggles to biohazard suits. They wipe down tray tables and arm rests with disinfectant. Some passengers say they avoid using the lavatory, even on long transcontinental flights, believing there is a higher risk of infection there. Many pack their own food, and keep their protective gear on even as they sleep. Lacking definitive information about how long the virus might linger on clothing or even one\u2019s own hair, they reasoned that more protection was better than less. When Billy Chan flew home to Hong Kong from London in mid-March, he wore a disposable protective suit, goggles and an N95 mask. He changed his mask twice during the 13-hour flight, using hand sanitizer each time. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone go on or off the plane without a mask,\u201d said Mr. Chan, who needed to return to Hong Kong to renew his visa to Britain. Most passengers, he reported, wore goggles or sunglasses as well. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t drink, I didn\u2019t wander around on the plane,\u201d he said. Stacie Tan, who flew to her home in Malaysia from Oregon on April 1, wore goggles, gloves and a mask on the plane. \u201cI knew that someone might look at me and laugh,\u201d Ms. Tan said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than lying in the hospital, right?\u201d The model Naomi Campbell  posted a photo of herself on Instagram accessorized in pink surgical gloves , a turquoise face mask and baggy white coveralls, the kind normally worn when removing asbestos. Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, said it made sense to wear protective gear on an airplane, given the tight quarters. \u201cI think the most important thing to do would be to wear a face covering, a mask of some sort,\u201d said Dr. Marr, who studies how viruses spread in the air. \u201cGoggles aren\u2019t a bad idea, especially if they will prevent you from touching your eyes.\u201d While a full-body protective suit \u201ccan\u2019t hurt,\u201d she said, the most important thing is to cover your nose and mouth, wash your hands a lot and avoid touching your eyes. \u201cCertainly, I wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to, or right in front of, or right behind someone else,\u201d Dr. Marr said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not explicitly advise against flying, but it  does warn  that \u201ccrowded travel settings\u201d could increase a person\u2019s chances of infection, and there are few travel settings as crowded as a sold-out flight. \u201cDepending on your unique circumstances, you may choose to delay or cancel your plans,\u201d the agency says. What it means to fly safely in the face of the coronavirus threat is likely to evolve in the coming months. Emirates, the Dubai-based airline,  announced last week  that it had begun conducting rapid coronavirus tests on passengers waiting to board, and said it hoped to scale up the practice to cover more flights. Alaska Airlines  says  it is keeping all middle seats vacant in economy class on its flights through May. American Airlines and United Airlines, the two largest American carriers, did not respond to queries about their policies or recommendations concerning personal protective gear. Brian Parrish, a spokesman for Southwest Airlines, said the most common protective gear worn by its staff were face masks and gloves. \u201cCustomers traveling with Southwest are welcome to wear personal protective equipment,\u201d Mr. Parrish said. \u201cThe only exception to this policy would be any equipment that might interfere with the safe operation of the aircraft or the safety and comfort of other customers.\u201d Vicky Ding, who traveled with her mother and brother to Beijing from New York by way of Hong Kong on March 18, wore a rain jacket, hairnet, a mask and goggles. Her mother brought plastic shower curtains to place on the seats, but they did not end up using them. \u201cThe airlines were still serving food, but half the people didn\u2019t eat it,\u201d Ms. Ding said. She drank a protein shake through a straw. Brian Campbell, who visited his parents\u2019 house in Oklahoma from California in mid-March, said he wore a mask for the entire journey, starting from his ride to the airport, to avoid bringing the virus with him. His taxi driver in Oklahoma commented on the mask and questioned whether it was necessary. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a culture of wearing a mask around,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cHopefully, now we\u2019ll move more in that direction.\u201d Mr. Chan, who flew to Hong Kong in March, says he felt the precautions he had taken were justified when the Hong Kong government announced, two days after he landed, that five people who were on his flight had tested positive for the virus. \u201cIt was tough wearing the N95 the whole time, and suffocating,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked really weird and awkward.\u201d But in hindsight, he said, \u201cit was all necessary.\u201d",

    "title": "The Women Doctors Who Fought to Serve in World War I - The New York Times",
    "text": "A riddle from my childhood goes like this: A father and son are injured in a serious car accident, and each is taken to a different hospital. As the boy is being prepped for surgery, the surgeon rushes in and exclaims in horror: \u201cI can\u2019t operate! He\u2019s my son.\u201d How is this possible? That the ludicrously obvious answer \u2014 the surgeon is a woman \u2014 eluded every member of my family except me, a 12-year-old girl, in 1975, makes the subject and the chronology of Wendy Moore\u2019s new book all the more thrilling. \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d tells the story of the Endell Street Military Hospital, which treated the casualties of war pouring into London during World War I \u2014 and which, except for the occasional male orderly, was staffed entirely by women. \u201cFrom the physician who assessed the condition of the patients to the surgeon who inspected their wounds, from the radiologist who ordered X-rays to the pathologist who took swabs, from the dentist who checked their teeth to the ophthalmologist who tested their sight, every one of the doctors was female,\u201d Moore writes. This was as shocking as it was revolutionary. Women doctors were almost unheard-of. Barred from studying at most institutions except for the London School of Medicine for Women, they were relegated to low-status, low-paying jobs in schools, prisons and asylums; most treated only other women and children. None of the men who would come to the Endell Street hospital had ever been treated by a woman before. But two pioneering doctors \u2014 Louisa Garrett Anderson, a 41-year-old surgeon whose mother, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, was the first woman ever to qualify as a doctor in Britain, and Flora Murray, 45, an exacting Scottish anesthesiologist \u2014 saw a vacuum, and rushed to fill it. The upending of conventions necessitated by the war, as well as the desperate need for new hospital beds to treat the tens of thousands of injured and sick soldiers converging on London, offered the perfect opportunity, Moore writes, to prove that women were equal to men. Both women were also passionate suffragists, and the struggle for the vote went hand in hand with the struggle for professional acceptance. (They also lived together, though their careers were so interesting that their sex lives seem almost beside the point.) Moore outlines the logistical and attitudinal impediments the pair encountered as they set up two hospitals in France at the start of the war and then turned their attention to Endell Street, where their hospital would be housed in a hulking Victorian workhouse that purportedly had inspired the school in \u201cOliver Twist.\u201d Though they had the blessing of the War Office, not everyone was excited about the prospect of health care performed by people other than men. \u201cGood God!  Women !\u201d one Royal Army Medical Corps colonel sniped, when he met the women at the hospital site during construction (he then flounced out in a huff). Many of the men assigned to the task there were reluctant to help. \u201cDesperate to clear the laundry room of hundreds of damp and filthy mattresses,\u201d Moore writes, \u201cthe two women tracked down the official responsible for their removal and refused to let him leave his office for the weekend until he telephoned through the required order.\u201d But there was little time for messing around. The first casualties arrived in May, 1915, in convoys of up to 80 men at a time; by the end of the first week, all 520 beds were filled. Typically, between 400 and 800 new patients would arrive each month, many needing immediate surgery (much of it performed by Anderson), many with grievously infected wounds, many suffering from acute shell-shock, \u201cmore wounded in their minds than in their bodies.\u201d They had come to a London undergoing radical change, a city full of women doing jobs that always been assigned to men. Soon, even skeptics were praising the skill and competence of Endell Street\u2019s doctors, how they brought compassion as well as expertise to the task. \u201cThey are men in the best sense of that word, and yet women in the best sense of that word also,\u201d the society magazine Tatler wrote, straining to express what it was trying to say. Moore has an eye for a telling detail and a nose for a good character. After the husband of the American actress Elizabeth Robins \u2014 a volunteer at the hospital \u2014 drowned himself in a fit of depression and jealousy, she regularly fended off suitors of both sexes and, as Moore writes, \u201conce pushed George Bernard Shaw out of a taxi into the gutter.\u201d One of the orderlies smuggled an Alsatian puppy out of France, possibly in her bra, and named it \u201cEepie\u201d after Ypres, the Belgian battle site. After learning needlework in his convalescence at the hospital, one patient, a coal miner, produced \u201ca picture depicting a basket of fruit.\u201d The weather was so grim in the winter of 1916 that Cynthia Asquith, the daughter-in-law of the former prime minister, \u201cwas reduced to wearing her fur coat at breakfast.\u201d Exhausted, worked to the bone, forced to improvise and develop new techniques on the fly, the women proved themselves capable of handling nearly everything thrown at them during the war. It is hard, in the spring of 2020, to read about the thing that brought them to the point of despair. It was the Spanish flu, which came in three waves during 1918 and 1919 and killed between 3 and 6 percent of the world\u2019s population. The details seem wearyingly familiar. The illness began with mild symptoms until victims drowned in their own fluids, bleeding from their lungs. \u201cEntire families were struck down at once,\u201d Moore writes. \u201cBuses and trams were canceled for lack of staff; emergency services were dangerously stretched as police, fire and ambulance workers fell ill; and hospitals struggled to cope as nurses and doctors collapsed alongside their patients.\u201d There was no treatment, no protocol for the doctors to follow. But that pandemic finally passed, as this one will, too, and life began again. The Endell Street hospital closed in October 1919. And though most of the women doctors were cruelly sidelined in the postwar years as men poured back into the city and the hospitals, the tide had started to turn. Some women in the United Kingdom got the right to vote in 1918; the rest in 1928. Meticulously researched, written with \u00e9lan and wit, Moore\u2019s account comes at just the right time. We\u2019re not in a war, but it\u2019s not difficult to understand what it felt like in London as World War I raged on. We are so vulnerable. So many of the things we take for granted \u2014 our jobs, our health, our ability to live our lives freely and openly, our trust in our leaders to do the right thing \u2014 are in jeopardy. But \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d reminds us that people can rise to an occasion, that the biggest advances \u2014 for medicine, for humanity \u2014 can come during the toughest times, as a result of the toughest times. It reminds us that great courage and great ingenuity are possible even when the world feels very dark.",

    "title": "Viruses and other germs: winning a never-ending war (Opinion) - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) Humans are at war with a foreign and hostile life-form. And no, this is not the \"War of the Worlds\" \u2014 it is a war we have been fighting since the beginning of history, and long before.  Human history can be described as an everlasting struggle between people and microscopic pathogens, as author and historian William McNeill taught us a generation ago. We are dealing with a deadly, stubborn, and protean set of enemies. Some are viruses, some are bacteria and some are parasites. Each one is different in how they make us sick and how we fight them.   In 2020 the human race looks vulnerable: global supply chains and travel cause outbreaks in one location to spread worldwide in days, not decades as in the past. Our economy is a highly sophisticated machine that has a difficult time coping on short notice with disasters that few saw coming. There is good reason to think that the economy will not fully bounce back until after we have developed an effective vaccine and then scaled up its production to the hundreds of millions of doses we need in the US and billions world-wide. That could take many months, perhaps even a few years. The economic cost is nothing short of mind-boggling, and the social consequences could be chilling. And yet, as terrible as it may sound, given the awful death toll, from a longtime perspective, if Covid-19 had to hit us, maybe 2020 is the best time. At least we measure the duration of the devastation in months, not decades. In the past, we were not so lucky. Bubonic Plague  appeared in Europe in 1347 , killed  around a third of the population , and stuck around there for centuries, and in Asia even longer.  Infectious diseases wiped out much of the population of the American continent after Europeans showed up. Smallpox ravaged much of humanity for centuries before an  effective vaccine was discovered in 1796.   Cholera terrorized many of the urban centers of the 19th century until its carrier was understood and vanquished, even if it still looks for (and at times finds) opportunities to raise its ugly head. Polio, the great fear of the 1930s and 1940s, took many years to be conquered by the genius of Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. Even HIV-AIDS is under control, though it took 15 years from the time it was first recognized until it started to fade slowly in 1996. The war of people against malevolent pathogens is not over, and never will be. But this will surprise many readers: Covid-19 is a rear-guard action. In the 20th century, the percentage of people who died of infectious diseases declined to a tiny fraction of what it had been in 1900 (in the US, it  plummeted from nearly 800 to about 60 per 100,000 by 1996,  a decline of 92.5%)  A glance at mortality-by-cause data for the 20th century reveals two things. First, the longtime trend of death by infectious diseases is steeply down: The main causes of death in 1900  were all infectious diseases,  whereas in 2019,  non-infectious causes dominated  and contagious diseases were relegated to the also-ran category.  Second, infectious diseases did not disappear altogether, however, and made deadly if temporary comebacks in 1918 (Spanish flu) and the 1980s (HIV).  In the end, then, we will see Covid-19 join smallpox, measles, cholera, tuberculosis, and bubonic plague in the graveyard of defeated pathogens. Malaria is not quite there yet, but  Bill and Melinda Gates are on the case.  Not all of those diseases have quite been eliminated. But when they reappear, it's usually because of humanity's unforced errors. The reason is totally obvious: Unlike our forefathers, we know who the enemies are. Think of infectious disease as a tenacious band of killers that never quite disappears but becomes dormant, only to pop up again and again, unexpectedly, in a different guise.  For example, Zika, Ebola and swine flu. They are organisms with no consciousness and no agency, programmed by evolution to multiply rapidly and spread if they can: mindless biology imposed on an integrated world.  We cannot let our guards down as we are apt to do, because no two pandemics are alike. The way it works is that we throw things at them that work for a while, then we need to recalibrate. But thanks to modern science, we are getting better and better at this recalibration. So while the war is never-ending, there is little doubt that humans are winning; we have knowledge, they have evolution. Bet on knowledge. The scientific response to Covid-19 has been lightning-fast. Within weeks scientists had  sequenced its genome  and are  actively looking for vulnerabilities .   It is a matter of (historically) a short time until we find them. What is more, the Covid virus is serving as a \"focusing device\" \u2014 all of a sudden scientists of many stripes are concentrating on one topic. History is full of examples in which society \"recognizes\" an urgent problem and sets its best minds upon solving it. As 18th century writer Dr. Samuel Johnson memorably said, \"Depend upon it, sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\" One thinks of the urgent need of eighteenth century sailors to determine longitude at sea, the pressing need that Germans had for nitrogen on the eve of World War I, or the concentrated efforts made in Project Manhattan.  The best and the brightest are putting their minds to combat Covid-19: to find cheap and reliable tests and in the end the holy grail, a vaccine.  While politicians squabble and point fingers at one another, researchers collaborate, compare, and communicate.     Scientists are bringing to the battlefield a set of weapons that would have boggled the minds of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur: they have advanced molecular virology and immunology, computational genomics,  gene-editing technology, sophisticated epidemiological models, unprecedented tools to store and analyze huge data banks, and ultra-powerful microscopes to peek at extremely small things. Their arsenal is still far from perfect, as we are becoming painfully aware. But it is a lot better than what they had while fighting the deadly flu of 1918, which killed possibly  100 million people world-wide. The very identification of the influenza virus as the immediate cause of that epidemic did not occur  until the 1930s.  Human coronaviruses were identified in the  mid-1960s.     This is a difficult time for humanity on a global scale. Gloom is natural and inevitable. But we should bear in mind that the kind of economic world we have built, founded on knowledge and research, will aim the full power of its mighty artillery on this virus, and sooner rather than later, will zap it too. Until the next one comes around.",

    "title": "2020 NFL Draft: Joe Burrow selected by Cincinnati Bengals - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) The  2020 NFL Draft  -- held virtually for the first time ever -- is underway and, as expected, the Cincinnati Bengals selected former Louisiana State University quarterback Joe Burrow with the first overall pick. The Bengals' front office didn't need to overthink this one, as Burrow's spectacular final season at LSU positioned him as an easy top choice.  Burrow's pinpoint accuracy was on display all season as he finished the year with a 76.3 completion percentage while throwing for 5,671 yards and 60 touchdowns against only six interceptions. He did this all while proving that he can remain poised on the big stage. In three College Football Playoff games, Burrow threw for an absurd 1,305 yards, 16 touchdowns and zero interceptions while leading the Tigers to a National Championship over Clemson in the title game. \"Enough talk,\" Burrow wrote in a  tweet , which was a response to the Bengals' welcome tweet. \"Time to get to work.\" This marks the first time in the common draft era that a Heisman Trophy winner was selected No. 1 overall in three consecutive drafts.  The virtual draft replaced what was supposed to be an extravagant event planned along the Las Vegas strip, with thousands in attendance. The league was going to ferry players via boat to a stage on the Bellagio fountain.  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, however, plans changed.  Players, coaches, general managers, analysts and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell instead broadcast live from their homes. All 32 teams are also participating remotely. With  live sports canceled across the US , the virtual draft is as close to a live sporting event that sports-starved fans are able to watch.  \"We're obviously staging this event in a much different way than we anticipated when we started,\" Goodell, who announced picks  from his basement , said in an interview with ESPN before the draft. \"We're not in Las Vegas, unfortunately, but we're all in our homes and we're doing this remotely and we're doing it within regulations without any exceptions. While Burrow was unable to shake Goodell's hand and walk across what was supposed to be an extravagant stage in Las Vegas, the quarterback still gets to fulfill his dream of making it to the NFL. No. 2 pick Chase Young is widely viewed as a \"can't-miss prospect.\" The edge rusher from Ohio State is explosive, powerful, and the type of talent that offensive coordinators will have nightmares trying to game plan against. He also has a wide range of pass-rush moves that will leave offensive lineman grasping at air. Young won the Bednarik Trophy in 2019, which is awarded to the best defensive player in college football. He was a dominant force in 2019 despite being suspended for two games. In his final two seasons with the Buckeyes, he racked up 27 sacks, 35.5 tackles for a loss and eight forced fumbles. He also set Ohio State's single-season record for sacks with 16.5 in his final year with the team despite only playing in 12 games. New York Giants play it safe New York Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman's tenure has been riddled with questionable moves, and the team has holes to fill all over the roster. Many experts expected the Giants to trade down and acquire more draft capital, but with no offers or deals, Gettleman selected offensive tackle Andrew Thomas out of Georgia. This pick is a clear investment into protecting the team's last two top draft picks: running back Saquon Barkley and quarterback Daniel Jones. Thomas is a powerful lineman and safe pick that should start from day one. Tua Tagovailoa The Miami Dolphins selected Tua Tagovailoa with the No. 5 overall pick. There were a lot of questions over Tagovailoa's health after he sat out most of his final season at Alabama with a hip injury. Tagovailoa proved to be a dynamic playmaker in college and has the makings of a star in the NFL. His accuracy, decision-making and pocket presence makes him one of the most exciting players in this year's draft. As a true freshman, Tagovailoa replaced quarterback Jalen Hurts in the second half of the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship and led Alabama to victory with a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime.  He followed up his MVP performance with a stellar sophomore season where he threw for 3,966 yards, 43 touchdowns and six interceptions. He led Alabama to another National Championship game appearance, where the team lost to Clemson. Justin Herbert Six picks in and three quarterbacks are already off the board. The Los Angeles Chargers selected Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert with its first-round pick. Herbert has the arm, size and athleticism to excel at the next level. Playing the game's most important position, it's no surprise that Herbert was selected in the top 10. After quarterback Philip Rivers left the team in the offseason, it was clear that the team needed to draft its quarterback of the future. While the team signed quarterback Tyrod Taylor in the offseason, he was likely just a stop-gap until they found someone to lead the Chargers into the next decade. There's no need to rush Herbert, as they can sit him and let him develop behind Taylor until he proves ready to take over. First wide receiver taken off the board The 2020 draft class has been viewed as one of the best receiving draft classes in years, and it took 12 picks for the first wide receiver to be taken off the board. However, the Oakland Raiders opted to go with speedster Henry Ruggs III instead of receivers CeeDee Lamb or Jerry Jeudy at No. 12. Ruggs ran a scorching fast 4.27-second 40-yard dash, and he will enter the league as one of the fastest players in the league. His elite speed makes him a touchdown threat every time he steps on the field, but he needs to develop his route-running abilities to become a truly elite player at the next level. The first trade of the night With Tom Brady under center, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers made the first trade of the night to move up from 14 to 13 in order to select offensive tackle Tristan Wirfs out of Iowa to protect the 42-year-old quarterback. Brady has always played best when he has a clean pocket, and Wirfs will certainly help keep him upright. Wirfs was expected to be a potential top 10 pick, so the Buccaneers are getting good value for a position they needed to shore up. Athletic, agile and strong, Wirfs is arguably the best pass blocker in the draft.",

    "title": "Biden must choose 'the woman in Michigan' - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) There's only one winnable choice for Joe Biden's vice president pick: \"The woman in Michigan,\" as our  incumbent President calls  Gretchen Whitmer. What the American people -- not to mention the world -- want and need in these dangerous times is a person who, if necessary, can slip seamlessly into the job of president amidst a global crisis.  That has to mean a governor rather than a senator. No senator (with the  possible exception of Mitt Romney ), has the managerial chops to step in and assume control on a moment's notice of the world's largest corporation: the US government, currently careening toward utter disaster.  The staff budgets of a senator are pocket change compared to federal budgets. If a senator represents a state with a population larger than 28 million,  their budget maxes out  at $4.6 million for administrative, clerical and legislative staff, and less than $500,000  for rented offices. Moreover, with legislative staff salaries topping out at more than $170,000 a year, the size of senators' offices are quite circumscribed. The US budget, managed by the president, has  risen to $4.8 trillion  under President Trump's fiscal 2021 budget request. And that's before the  $2 trillion more authorized  by the recent coronavirus bailout bill. The workforce the  President manages is estimated  to be just about 4.3 million people. By contrast, America's largest private employer, Walmart,  has 1.5 million workers  in the US, dwarfing number two, Amazon,  with about 750,000 . In comparison, Michigan's government totals than 46,000 workers with a budget  in excess of $61.9 billion .  At the same time, this person must have an understanding of the world and America's place in it. Last November,  Gov. Whitmer deftly led  a trade mission to Israel, signing an agreement to connect Israeli business to Michigan. In the months before the current administration  officially withdrew  from the Paris Climate Accord,  she reformed  her state's own Department of Environmental Quality, clearly embracing a global vision for modern environmental practices. She's not reluctant to unleash that power brandished so flagrantly and irresponsibly by Donald Trump. Her first mission after the pandemic, and that of Joe Biden, must be to return America to the community of democratic nations, and the COP-21  world environmental treaty . Certainly, any number of choices for vice president would serve more effectively than the incumbents occupying the presidency and vice presidency. But it must be a governor who represents the heartland and it must be a woman, as Biden himself has pledged. That leaves only three candidates: Whitmer, New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham and Laura Kelly of Kansas. My vote is for Whitmer. While the Democratic party's progressive base may need mobilizing with the withdrawal of the two senators, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, it's clear that in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections it was the suburban soccer moms and minorities  who came out in force  to bring the House over to the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi to the speakership. These suburban voters and industrial workers, especially in the Midwest heartland, are what the party needs to keep cultivating. Joe Biden must win Michigan. New York, Massachusetts and both coasts are a lock. Besides, any progressive worth his or her salt will recognize that sending Trump packing is essential at any cost. Whitmer's website describes her  as \"a lawyer, an educator, former prosecutor, State Representative and Senator. She was the first woman to lead a Senate caucus. But the most important title she boasts is MOM.\" In other words, she checks all the boxes. The state she heads is the heartland of the American auto industry with a truly global reach and broader aspirations. And she's served for 20 years -- far more experienced than New Mexico's Grisham, for instance, with three terms in Congress and 15 months as governor.  Finally,  there's her handling of  the entire pandemic in her state, one of the several epicenters of the virus's spread across America, the state with the third-highest  number of deaths  from Covid-19.  Whitmer has inaugurated some  of the toughest restrictions in the nation, from travel bans to vacation homes to the sale of paint, garden supplies and furniture. And despite widespread demonstrations carefully orchestrated by national conservatives,  she's stood her ground . No senator brings these chops to the party. Whitmer brings her skills as a governor and public official who has unfailingly seen from the get-go what her state needs in this, its most critical hour, and with laser-like precision has gone after it. With her leadership skills, she has also shown herself prepared to do so for the nation as well. ",

    "title": "2 Brothers Died of Covid. They\u2019re Being Denied Their Last Wish. - The New York Times",
    "text": "When Javier Morales, 48, died at a hospital in Hackensack, N.J., his family decided not to tell his brother Martin right away. Martin Morales was also battling the coronavirus, and they worried about how he would handle the news. But Mr. Morales, 39, found out from a friend later that night, in his New Jersey home. The next day, on April 7, he died, too. \u201cMy family likes to think that he could not live without his older brother. They were best friends,\u201d said Melanie Cruz Morales, 19, the niece of both men. \u201cThey had to go together.\u201d Since then, Ms. Cruz and her twin sister have been trying to raise thousands of dollars and navigate the bureaucracies of two countries to grant the last wish of their uncles \u2014 to be buried in their birthplace, the tiny village of Santa Catarina Yosonot\u00fa in Oaxaca, Mexico. If the coronavirus outbreak has transformed life around New York City, it has also transformed death. Lonely deaths are followed by lonely burials. Urns are handed over without the usual ceremonies and tributes to the lost. For the area\u2019s Mexican immigrants \u2014 a community already hit hard by the virus \u2014 the pandemic has brought another cruel change. Mexican families typically send bodies home, for flower-strewn Catholic burials, and to give relatives the chance to glimpse their loved ones again after long separations. The tradition is so important that Mexican consulates around the country have long helped to repatriate the bodies of immigrants. But that sacred rite has come to a halt. More than 250 Mexican immigrants are known to have died of Covid-19 in the New York area,  according to the Mexican government . But officials in the area are not issuing the transit permits needed for repatriation, and parts of Mexico have closed their borders to bodies, fearing contagion. The Mexican Consulate in New York, which has temporarily shut its doors, is advising families who call to consider cremation; ashes can far more easily be sent home. Ms. Cruz said her family was crushed to hear this news. \u201cBecause my grandmother who is back in Mexico, all she ever wanted was to see her sons.\u201d \u201cMexican families always love to bring their loved one back home,\u201d said Stephanie Garcia Morales, a funeral director at International Funeral Service of New York, and herself the child of Mexican immigrants. \u201cThey want the body there. They don\u2019t want ashes there. They want the physical body. The person there in Mexico.\u201d The blow is not just emotional. Now, relatives who in many cases have lost jobs and drained their savings to pay medical bills also have to come up with thousands of dollars to pay for cremations, a cost that often includes a storage fee, because of the deep backlog at crematories. In New York City, such families have faced an added strain: Until very recently, they were given two weeks to find a funeral home to claim their loved one\u2019s bodies, or they would be buried in the city\u2019s potter\u2019s field on Hart Island. This week, city officials  revised the plan , announcing bodies will be frozen to give families more time to claim them before they are interred on Hart Island. The fear of losing a loved one to a mass grave was profound. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re accustomed to seeing in war-torn countries,\u201d said Francisco Moya, a councilman from a part of Queens  ravaged by the outbreak . For some immigrant communities, the comparison was all too real. Rather than wait, dozens of Mexican families have turned to social media and to crowdfunding sites, seeking to raise money from their communities and beyond to cremate their relatives\u2019 remains and send their ashes back to hometowns. In the process, GoFundMe has become the closest thing to a memorial that exists for the Mexican victims of Covid-19 around New York. There are pages for women and men; construction workers, kitchen workers, hotel employees, nursing home attendants, babysitters. The victims include recent arrivals and immigrants who came decades ago, such as  Edmundo Garc\u00eda , 62, who worked at Salem and Sons Bakery in Union City, N.J., for 21 years, until the day he got sick. The victims are often remembered with  a single grainy photograph . The pleas are humble; the reason families give for needing help are often the same: \u201cWe want Adrian to be sent to Mexico,\u201d says the page for 39-year-old  Adrian Hern\u00e1ndez,  who worked at Carmine\u2019s Italian Restaurant in Times Square and supported his two children in Puebla.  David Rosales Flores, whose father,  Remigio Rosales Flores ,   died in his Brooklyn home, said families like his have been through ordeals. All they want now is to give their relatives in Mexico the chance for a final goodbye \u2014 \u201c el \u00faltimo adi\u00f3s .\u201d The pages barely hint at the hardships: the mountain of bills, the unemployed spouses and confused children, the squabbles with relatives. \u201cMy aunts were really upset that we made the page,\u201d said Leslie Puebla, who lost her father,  Tom\u00e1s Puebla , a longtime line cook at diners on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. \u201cThey said, \u2018A lot of people are jobless and they\u2019re struggling to make ends meet.\u2019\u201d But Ms. Puebla, 22, did not know how else to raise $5,200 for a funeral service for the father she adored, she said. Her mother, a housekeeper, is out of work. She still has a job, doing outreach for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, but earns $22 an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d said Javier H. Vald\u00e9s, the co-director of Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization that   has lost 38 of its working-class Latino members  to Covid-19. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety and frustration. First and foremost, how do you cover the cost?\u201d When  Gregorio Rosales , a 69-year-old livery cabdriver, died at a hospital in the Bronx, his nieces wondered the same thing. Mr. Rosales \u2014 their T\u00edo Goyo \u2014 was a single father who worked sporadically while shuttling his 13-year-old to medical appointments. She had been born with a host of health issues, and her mother had died of cancer. He had no savings, but had always wanted to go back to Mexico. \u201cThat\u2019s the dream. You think you\u2019ll go where you belong,\u201d said his niece Marisol Rojas, 35. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to end up dead in the Bronx.\u201d Ms. Rojas and her sister Dulce Mojica, 39, began working the phones. \u201cMy sister and I have been calling every single person we can think of to ask for help to pay for the cremation,\u201d said Ms. Mojica. \u201cI created a GoFundMe for long-distance relatives. Little by little, we have been gathering money.\u201d New York City offers  burial assistance  to low-income families. But the relatives of undocumented immigrants like Mr. Rosales are excluded from receiving the $900 in aid, because the application requires a Social Security number both for the person who died and the person requesting assistance. Mr. Moya, the Queens councilman, is proposing that the city create an emergency fund to extend burial assistance to all low-income families who have lost loved ones to Covid-19, regardless of immigration status. He also wants to expand the program to cover the cost of cremations as well as burials. \u201cLet\u2019s allow these people to say goodbye to their loved ones in a dignified way,\u201d Mr. Moya said. When the Morales brothers got sick, their wages evaporated. One was a long-haul trucker and one worked in a produce warehouse, and what they had saved did not go far. Their nieces, college students who are able to legally live and work in the country through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, were left in charge. They  created a GoFundMe page for their uncles , and  took to Twitter , hoping that other immigrants of indigenous Mixtec descent might come to the family\u2019s aid. By this week, they had raised more than $20,000. Their uncles\u2019 funeral might not be as they had imagined it, Ms. Cruz said. There might not be caskets hoisted on their siblings\u2019 shoulders and carried to the cemetery. But there will at the very least be two urns, lifted high over Santa Catarina Yosonot\u00fa, the village their uncles helped sustain for so long. \u201cIf anything were ever to happen to me,\u201d Javier Morales had once told the mother of the twins, \u201cI would always want to go back to my land.\u201d He had become a U.S. citizen, and could travel back and forth easily with his new passport. His brother, Martin, was undocumented, and had never gone back at all.",

    "title": "Hidden Outbreaks Spread Through U.S. Cities Far Earlier Than Americans Knew, Estimates Say - The New York Times",
    "text": "By the time New York City confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on March 1, thousands of infections were already silently spreading through the city, a hidden explosion of a disease that many still viewed as a remote threat as the city awaited the first signs of spring. Hidden outbreaks were also spreading almost completely undetected in Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle, long before testing showed that each city had a major problem, according to a model of the spread of the disease by researchers at Northeastern University who shared their results with The New York Times. Even in early February \u2014 while the world focused on China \u2014 the virus was not only likely to be spreading in multiple American cities, but also seeding blooms of infection elsewhere in the United States, the researchers found. In five major U.S. cities, as of March 1  there were only  23 confirmed cases  of coronavirus. But according to the Northeastern model, there could have actually been about  28,000 infections  in those cities by then. Boston 2,300 Seattle 2,300 Chicago 3,300 San Francisco 9,300 New York 10,700 In five major U.S. cities, as of March 1  there were only  23 confirmed cases  of coronavirus. But according to the Northeastern model, there could have actually been about  28,000 infections  in those cities by then. Boston 2,300 Seattle 2,300 Chicago 3,300 San Francisco 9,300 New York 10,700 Note: Numbers are median estimates that the Northeastern model calculated for each city. The true number of infections could have been substantially higher or lower than shown here. By Derek Watkins As political leaders grappled in February with the question of whether the outbreak would become serious enough to order measures like school closures and remote work, little or no systematic testing for the virus was taking place. \u201cMeanwhile, in the background, you have this silent chain of transmission of thousands of people,\u201d said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research team. Modeling the spread of a disease is inherently inexact, involving estimates of how often people come in contact and transmit the virus as they travel, work and socialize. The model estimates all infections, including those in people who may experience mild or no symptoms and those that are never detected in testing. Other disease researchers said the findings of Dr. Vespignani\u2019s team were broadly in line with their own analyses. The research offers the first clear accounting of how far behind the United States was in detecting the virus. And the findings provide a warning of what can recur, the researchers say, if social distancing restrictions are lifted too quickly. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week that American health officials had been successful in tracking the first known cases and their contacts in the United States before the outbreak got out of control. \u201cThrough Feb. 27, this country only had 14 cases,\u201d he said during a briefing. \u201cWe did that isolation and that contact tracing, and it was very successful. But then, when the virus more exploded, it got beyond the public health capacity.\u201d But the new estimates of coronavirus infections are vastly higher than those official counts. By late February, as the world\u2019s attention shifted to a dire outbreak in Italy, those 14 known American cases were a tiny fraction of the thousands of undetected infections that the researchers estimated were spreading from person to person across this country. And more cases may have been arriving in the United States by the day. \u201cKnowing the number of flights coming into New York from Italy, it was like watching a horrible train wreck in slow motion,\u201d said Adriana Heguy, director of the Genome Technology Center at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine. Dr. Heguy\u2019s team and another at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found through genetic analysis that the seeds of most infections in New York came from multiple locations in Europe, rather than directly from China. \u201cWe weren\u2019t testing, and if you\u2019re not testing you don\u2019t know,\u201d Dr. Heguy said. The new estimates suggesting that thousands of infections were spreading silently in the first months of the year \u201cdon\u2019t seem surprising at all,\u201d she said. There are other signs that the outbreak was worse at an earlier point than previously known. This week, health officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., announced a  newly discovered coronavirus-linked death  on Feb. 6, weeks earlier than what had been previously thought to be the first death caused by the virus in the United States. Some scientists cautioned that the new report\u2019s estimates of an enormous, unseen wave of infections could be too high \u2014\u00a0even though testing surveillance lagged at the time. \u201cEven with these corrections, it\u2019s still on the high side \u2014 this is higher than I would have expected,\u201d said Dr. Donald Burke, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. Others said that the findings were in line with the fragmentary evidence that had been available until now. Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology and statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, said that her own risk estimates and  most recent projections  reveal a grim stealthiness of early coronavirus spread. \u201cBy the time you see a few cases, it\u2019s pretty certain that you already have an outbreak underway,\u201d Dr. Meyers said. Dr. Vespignani\u2019s approach models the outbreak over time based on what is known about the virus and where it has been detected. It estimates the spread of the disease by simulating the movements of individual people based on where people fly, how they move around, when they go to school and other data. By running the model under various conditions \u2014 when schools are closed, say \u2014 his team estimates where the virus may have spread undetected. Unseen carriers of the disease, many of them with mild symptoms or none at all, can still spread the virus. For that reason, by the time leaders in many cities and states took action, it was already too late to slow the initial spread. A few cities with early outbreaks, notably Seattle, are believed to have avoided enormous growth later by heeding the models available at the time and taking action well ahead of the rest of the country. \u201cWe knew the numbers we saw were just the tip of the iceberg, and that there were much greater numbers below the surface,\u201d Jenny A. Durkan, the mayor of Seattle, said in an interview. \u201cWe had to act.\u201d City and state officials in New York acted more slowly , waiting until known cases were at a higher level to shut down schools and issue a stay-at-home order.  Mayor Bill de Blasio was reluctant to embrace shutdowns  until mid-March, citing the impact they would have on vulnerable New Yorkers. \u201cEven while we learn new things about this virus almost daily, one thing remains consistent: New Yorkers were put at risk by the federal government\u2019s total failure to provide us with adequate testing capability,\u201d said the mayor\u2019s press secretary, Freddi Goldstein. In mid-February, a month before New York City schools were closed, New York City and San Francisco already had more than 600 people with unidentified infections, and Seattle, Chicago and Boston already had more than 100 people, the findings estimate. By March 1, as New York confirmed its first case, the numbers there may already have surpassed 10,000. From these primary travel hubs and a few other cities, the model shows, the disease was then spread to other locations in the United States. Dr. Vespignani said he and his research team warned officials of the silent spread, posting some of their early projections in mid-February. \u201cWe were talking to officials here, and it was the same reaction we got in Italy, in the U.K., in Spain,\u201d Dr. Vespignani said. \u201cThey told me, \u2018OK, that\u2019s happening on your computer, not in reality.\u2019 Look,\u201d he added, \u201cNo one\u2019s going to shut down a country based on a model.\u201d The virus moved under the radar swiftly in February and March, doctors and researchers said, because few cities or states had adequate surveillance systems in place. And testing, if it was being done at all, was haphazard. Emergency rooms were busy preparing for the predicted onslaught and likely missed some early virus-related deaths, and did not have the time or tools to verify infections on the fly, experts said. It was mid-March before teams at N.Y.U. and Mount Sinai began taking samples for testing in New York. The new findings from the model produce a range of possible outcomes for when the virus may have infected 10 people in each city. In New York, for example, the model shows that the first 10 infected people could have been walking the streets of the city as early as the last week in January, or as late as the middle of February. From there, the infections in the centers of the outbreak grew exponentially. Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington in Seattle, said it became clear in late February that \u201ccommunity transmission\u201d \u2014 an infectious outbreak \u2014 was probably silently underway in Washington after a single test result came back positive for someone who had no symptoms. Whatever the precise scale of the initial outbreak, that same dynamic will accelerate once measures to mitigate the spread are relaxed without other public health measures in place, Dr. Burke said. \u201cWhen you take away social distancing, everything will go right through the roof,\u201d he said.",

    "title": "Opinion | Welcome to the Skype Pandemic - The New York Times",
    "text": "National crises are often identified by the media innovations they engender. The Persian Gulf war of 1991 was the turning point for CNN, the 10-year-old cable-news network that broadcast live the first United States bombs falling in Baghdad. The 2016 presidential contest will forever be remembered as the election when Twitter and other social media platforms became an irresistible force in national politics. Our current public-health crisis may well become known as the Skype pandemic. The outbreak of webcam interviews \u2014 on Skype and FaceTime, as well as other web-conferencing apps like Zoom and Cisco Webex \u2014 has nearly matched the spread of the coronavirus itself. With social distancing a necessity, familiar talking heads \u2014 political pundits, members of Congress, New York Times reporters \u2014 who used to show up in well-lit studios, dressed in presentable office attire and dabbed with a little makeup, now appear as fuzzy, low-resolution images transmitted from their home laptops and iPads. It is, to be sure, a triumph of journalistic improvisation: the media\u2019s creative, seat-of-the-pants response to a national crisis that has thrown out all the rules. Yet if the medium is the message, as Marshall McLuhan told us, it\u2019s time to ask whether all this rough-and-ready video journalism is affecting how we\u2019re viewing the current pandemic. One thing, at least, is hard to dispute: It almost surely contributed to the  bump in President Trump\u2019s approval ratings  late last month. Despite his early dithering on the looming pandemic, Mr. Trump quickly embraced the media advantages offered him. He appears each afternoon at a press briefing in front of live TV cameras \u2014 well lit, in focus, hair coifed and complexion bronzed to its usual otherworldly glow. (Are his makeup people wearing masks?) He looks, at least superficially, confident, in control, presidential. He gets to interrupt reporters and talk over questions he doesn\u2019t like. His  TV ratings , as he likes to brag, are excellent. Joe Biden, by contrast, has to sit in a makeshift studio in his Delaware basement, doing remote interviews marred, at least early on, by an annoying time delay that made the presumptive Democratic nominee seem even more tentative and fumbling than usual. Some of the technical problems have been resolved (though not Mr. Biden\u2019s meandering responses to questions he should have down pat by now). Still, he\u2019s stuck in a medium that makes him look less like a commanding chief executive than a homebound grandpa. Which, of course, he is. Yet Mr. Biden\u2019s sessions look polished next to some of the scrappy webcam interviews that are now ubiquitous on cable news: balky, lo-fi video; tinny, distorted, often out-of-sync sound; washed-out faces that can make distinguished scientists look like extras in \u201cThe Blair Witch Project.\u201d And then there\u2019s that familiar bane of satellite-TV interviews, a time delay that can turn the most sobering conversation into an awkward, overly polite  Alphonse and Gaston  comedy routine. The profusion of webcam interviews has had a democratizing effect that cuts both ways. On the one hand, the homemade, catch-as-catch-can interviews with doctors, nurses and E.M.S. workers on the front lines help to convey a sense of urgency; it\u2019s the sort of gritty video we usually get only from reporters in war zones or families trying to ride out Category 5 hurricanes. On the other hand, in a more subliminal way, the flattening of the journalistic curve may be muddling the message. When every medical expert looks no different from your garden-variety conspiracy theorist on the internet (or your Aunt Martha grappling with a FaceTime video call), the voices of authority become a little harder to distinguish, and to heed. Yet to understand how the webcam is affecting our response to the pandemic, it helps to go back to Mr. McLuhan \u2014 that brilliant, sometimes confounding guru of the media age \u2014 and his famous distinction between \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d media. A \u201chot\u201d medium (like movies or radio) delivers a high-definition sensory experience, allowing the user to simply sit back and absorb. Television, by contrast, is a \u201ccool\u201d medium; it delivers a comparatively low-definition image, and so requires more participation by the viewer to fill in the missing data and complete the picture. It would be interesting to see how Mr. McLuhan would account for the changes in technology since the early 1960s, when he published his seminal work, \u201cUnderstanding Media.\u201d The 19-inch, black-and-white Sylvania has been replaced by a 58-inch, high-definition TV, which now delivers images not that far removed from what we see in the movie theater. The \u201ccool\u201d TV medium has heated up considerably and been succeeded by an even cooler medium, the internet. Yet the Skypeing of TV news is, in terms of the sensory experience, a reversion to the television of an earlier era \u2014 the days of rabbit ears and fuzzy images, wavering signals and reaching for the vertical hold. And the upshot may be something like what Mr. McLuhan envisioned. \u201cTV will not work as background,\u201d he asserted. \u201cIt engages you. You have to be  with it.\u201d We\u2019re engaged now, of course, because we\u2019re stuck in the house and inundated with scary images of what it means to go outside. But those crude, herky-jerky webcam interviews may be having a greater impact simply because they force the viewer to do some work: to complete the image, to decipher the audio, to participate in a way we don\u2019t with the normal diet of slick cable-news interviews and round tables. The webcam interview isn\u2019t only affecting the message; it is demystifying the messenger. Familiar talking heads, forced out of the studio, now sit in their living room or home office (bookshelves usually behind them), blurrier and sounding like they\u2019re inside an oil drum \u2014 but more relatable, like well-informed neighbors. \u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel, one of several late-night hosts now doing their shows from home, \u201cI used to pretend I was hosting a talk show in my kitchen. And finally that dream has come true.\u201d What we\u2019re living through now is more like a nightmare. But it will eventually end, and the question is whether the media\u2019s transformation will too. The cable-news hosts and their guests will almost certainly return to their slick, well-appointed studios. But the networks may see the webcam interview as a money-saving opportunity, no camera operator required, and it will continue to flourish. How will that affect the medium, and the message? Our current crisis will have to be well past before that fuzzy picture gets clearer.

    "title": "Clean Water Act Covers Groundwater Discharges, Supreme Court Rules - The New York Times",
    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Clean Water Act applies to some pollutants that reach the sea and other protected waters indirectly through groundwater. The case,  County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund , No. 18-260, concerned a wastewater treatment plant on Maui, Hawaii, that used injection wells to dispose of some four million gallons of treated sewage each day by pumping it into groundwater about a half-mile from the Pacific Ocean. Some of the waste reached the ocean. Environmental groups sued, calling it  \u201cthe clean water case of the century.\u201d  A ruling in favor of the treatment plant \u201cwould open a massive loophole for every polluter in the country to avoid regulation,\u201d David L. Henkin, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said in November. In the Supreme Court, the Trump administration filed  a brief supporting Maui County , which operates the treatment plant, saying that the law does not apply to discharges that travel through groundwater before reaching protected waters. In a 6-to-3 ruling, the court rejected what it called the extreme positions advanced by the parties and the administration, returning the case to an appeals court for reconsideration under a new standard. But the decision was on balance a victory for environmental groups, as it allowed at least some lawsuits over groundwater discharges. \u201cThis decision is a huge victory for clean water,\u201d said Mr. Henkin, who argued the case on behalf of environmental groups. \u201cThe Supreme Court has rejected the Trump administration\u2019s effort to blow a big hole in the Clean Water Act\u2019s protections for rivers, lakes and oceans.\u201d The Clean Water Act requires \u201cpoint sources\u201d of pollution to obtain permits for \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters.\u201d Failing to have a permit can subject polluters to daily fines of more than $50,000. It was undisputed that the injection wells in Maui were \u201cpoint sources.\u201d The case turned largely on whether indirect discharges were considered \u201cfrom\u201d the wells. When  the case was argued in November , the lawyers debated whether, say, whiskey added to punch from a flask could be said to be \u201cfrom\u201d the original bottle or, indeed, from a barrel in Scotland. In the decision on Thursday, the justices similarly debated whether a traveler could be said to have simultaneously come from the train station, Baltimore and Europe and whether a recipe calling for adding drippings from meat to gravy made sense when the drippings were collected from a pan. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the majority, rejected both sides\u2019 positions in the case as too extreme. The county and the Trump administration had argued that discharges into groundwater were never covered, while environmental groups suing the county said the law applied to discharges that \u201cactually and foreseeably reach navigable surface waters.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco,  ruled for the environmental groups , saying the law applied because pollution in the ocean was \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the wells. That standard was too broad, Justice Breyer wrote. \u201cVirtually all water, polluted or not, eventually makes its way to navigable water,\u201d he wrote. The question courts should ask, he wrote, was whether \u201cthe addition of the pollutants through groundwater is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge from the point source into navigable waters.\u201d The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach, he wrote, \u201cwould require a permit in surprising, even bizarre, circumstances, such as for pollutants carried to navigable waters on a bird\u2019s feathers, or, to mention more mundane instances, the 100-year migration of pollutants through 250 miles of groundwater to a river.\u201d But the opposite extreme, as argued by the county and the administration, would allow polluters to evade the law, Justice Breyer wrote. \u201cWhy could not the pipe\u2019s owner, seeking to avoid the permit requirement, simply move the pipe back, perhaps only a few yards, so that the pollution must travel through at least some groundwater before reaching the sea?\u201d he asked. In requiring \u201cthe functional equivalent of a direct discharge,\u201d Justice Breyer listed several factors for courts to consider. \u201cTime and distance are obviously important,\u201d he wrote, but he listed five other considerations, too, including the material through which the pollutants travel and whether they are diluted or chemically altered along the way. \u201cIf the pipe ends 50 miles from navigable waters and the pipe emits pollutants that travel with groundwater, mix with much other material, and end up in navigable waters only many years later,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe permitting requirements likely do not apply.\u201d Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion, which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit for application of the new standard, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, said the law applied \u201conly when a point source discharges pollutants directly into navigable waters.\u201d In a separate dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the majority opinion \u201cmakes up a rule that provides no clear guidance and invites arbitrary and inconsistent application.\u201d \u201cThe court,\u201d he wrote, \u201cadopts a nebulous standard, enumerates a non-exhaustive list of potentially relevant factors, and washes its hands of the problem.\u201d",

    "title": "My Restaurant Was My Life for 20 Years. Does the World Need It Anymore? - The New York Times",
    "text": "O n the night before I laid off all 30 of my employees, I dreamed that my two children had perished, buried alive in dirt, while I dug in the wrong place, just five feet away from where they were actually smothered. I turned and spotted the royal blue heel of my youngest\u2019s socked foot poking out of the black soil only after it was too late. For 10 days, everyone in my orbit had been tilting one way one hour, the other the next. Ten days of being waterboarded by the news, by tweets, by friends, by my waiters. Of being inundated by texts from fellow chefs and managers \u2014 former employees, now at the helm of their own restaurants but still eager for guidance. Of gentle but nervous pleas from my operations manager to consider signing up with a third-party delivery service like Caviar. Of being rattled even by my own wife, Ashley, and her anxious compulsion to act, to reduce our restaurant\u2019s operating hours, to close at 9 p.m., cut shifts. With no clear directive from any authority \u2014 public schools were still open \u2014 I spent those 10 days sorting through the conflicting chatter, trying to decide what to do. And now I understood abruptly: I would lay everybody off, even my wife. Prune, my Manhattan restaurant, would close at 11:59 p.m. on March 15. I had only one piece of unemotional data to work with: the checking-account balance. If I triaged the collected sales tax that was sitting in its own dedicated savings account and left unpaid the stack of vendor invoices, I could fully cover this one last week of payroll. By the time of the all-staff meeting after brunch that day, I knew I was right. After a couple of weeks of watching the daily sales dwindle \u2014 a $12,141 Saturday to a $4,188 Monday to a $2,093 Thursday \u2014 it was a relief to decide to pull the parachute cord. I didn\u2019t want to have waited too long, didn\u2019t want to crash into the trees. Our sous chef FaceTimed in, as did our lead line cook, while nearly everyone else gathered in the dining room. I looked everybody in the eye and said, \u201cI\u2019ve decided not to wait to see what will happen; I encourage you to call first thing in the morning for unemployment, and you have a week\u2019s paycheck from me coming.\u201d After the meeting, there was some directionless shuffling. Should we collect our things? Grab our knives? Stay and have a drink? There was still one last dinner, so four of us \u2014 Ashley and I; our general manager, Anna; and Jake, a beloved line cook \u2014 worked the last shift at Prune for who knows how long. Some staff members remained behind to eat with one another, spending their money in house. As word trickled out, some long-ago alumnae reached out to place orders for meals they would never eat. From Lauren Kois, who waited tables at Prune all through her Ph.D. program and is now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Alabama: 2 dark and stormies shrimp w anchovy fried oysters (we\u2019re pretending it\u2019s a special tonight) Leo Steen Jurassic Chenin Blanc skate wing treviso salad potatoes in duck fat brothy beans breton butter cake 2 black coffees + 50 percent TIP Ashley worked the grill station and cold appetizers, while also bartending and expediting. Anna waited and hosted and answered the phone. Jake worked all 10 burners alone. I was in a yellow apron handling the dish pit, clearing the tables and running bus tubs, and I broke into tears for a second when I learned of Kois\u2019s order. The word \u201cfamily\u201d is thrown around in restaurants for good reason. We banked $1,144 in total sales. As our staff left that night, we waved across the room to one another with a strange mixture of longing and eye-rolling, still in the self-conscious phase of having to act so distant from one another, all of us still so unaware of what was coming. Then, as I was running a last tray of glassware before mopping the floors, Ashley leaned over to announce: \u201cHey, he just called it. De Blasio. It\u2019s a shutdown. You beat it by five hours, babe.\u201d The next day, a Monday, Ashley started assembling 30 boxes of survival-food kits for the staff. She packed Ziploc bags of nuts, rice, pasta, cans of curry paste and cartons of eggs, while music played from her cellphone tucked into a plastic quart container \u2014 an old line-cook trick for amplifying sound. I texted a clip of her mini-operation to Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who called immediately with encouragement: We will win this together! We feed the world one plate at a time! Ashley had placed a last large order from our wholesaler: jarred peanut butter, canned tuna, coconut milk and other unlikely items that had never appeared on our order history. And our account rep, Marie Elena Corrao \u2014 we met when I was her first account 20 years ago; she came to our wedding in 2016 \u2014 put the order through without even clearing her throat, sending the truck to a now-shuttered business. She knew as well as we did that it would be a long while before the bill was paid. Leo, from the family-owned butchery we\u2019ve used for 20 years, Pino\u2019s Prime Meat Market, called not to diplomatically inquire about our plans but to immediately offer tangibles: \u201cWhat meats do you ladies need for the home?\u201d He offered this even though he knew that there were 30 days\u2019 worth of his invoices in a pile on my desk, totaling thousands of dollars. And all day a string of neighborhood regulars passed by on the sidewalk outside and made heart hands at us through the locked French doors. It turned out that abruptly closing a restaurant is a weeklong, full-time job. I was bombarded with an astonishing volume of texts. The phone rang throughout the day, overwhelmingly well-wishers and regretful cancellations, but there was a woman who apparently hadn\u2019t followed the coronavirus news. She cut me off in the middle of my greeting with, \u201cYeah, you guys open for brunch?\u201d Then she hung up before I could even finish saying, \u201cTake care out there.\u201d Ashley spent almost three days packing the freezers, sorting the perishables in the walk-in into categories like \u201cToday would be good!\u201d or \u201cThis will be good for the long haul!\u201d We tried burying par-cooked chickens under a tight seal of duck fat to see if we could keep them perfectly preserved in their airtight coffins. She pickled the beets and the brussels sprouts, churned quarts of heavy cream into butter. I imagined I would tackle my other problems quickly. I emailed my banker. For sales taxes, liquor invoices and impending rent, I hoped to apply for a modest line of credit to float me through this crisis. I thought having run $2.5 million to $3 million through my bank each year for the past two decades would leave me poised to see a line of credit quickly, but then I remembered that I switched banks in the past year. Everyone in my industry encouraged me to apply for an S.B.A. disaster loan \u2014 I estimated we wouldn\u2019t need much; for 14 days, $50,000 \u2014 so I sent in my query. [After we closed down Prune, we diligently conserved our resources \u2014 until we didn\u2019t.] In the meantime, I made a phone call to Ken, my insurance broker of 20 years, who explained \u2014 in his patient, technical, my-hands-are-tied voice \u2014 that this coronavirus business interruption wouldn\u2019t likely be covered. He intended to file for damages, as he would if this shutdown had been mandated because of a nearby flood or a fire, but he doubted I would get any money. That afternoon, I saw the courtesy email from our workers\u2019-comp carrier that the next installment of our payment plan would be drafted automatically from our bank in six days. Knowing the balance, I snorted to myself:  Good luck with that.  I called Ken about this, and he got them to postpone the draw. And then, finally, three weeks of adrenaline drained from me. I checked all the pilot lights and took out the garbage; I stopped swimming so hard against the mighty current and let it carry me out. I had spent 20 years in this place, beginning when I was a grad student fresh out of school, through marriage and children and divorce and remarriage, with funerals and first dates in between; I knew its walls and light switches and faucets as well I knew my own body. It was dark outside when Ashley and I finally rolled down the gates and walked home. Prune is a cramped  and lively bistro in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, with a devoted following and a tight-knit crew. I opened it in 1999. It has only 14 tables, which are jammed in so close together that not infrequently you put down your glass of wine to take a bite of your food and realize it\u2019s on your neighbor\u2019s table. Many friendships have started this way. What was I imagining 20 years ago when I was working all day, every day at a catering job while staying up all night every night, writing menus and sketching the plating of dishes, scrubbing the walls and painting the butter-yellow trim inside what would become Prune? I\u2019d seen the padlocked space, formerly a failed French bistro, when it was decrepit: cockroaches crawling over the sticky Pernod bottles behind the bar and rat droppings carpeting the floors. But even in that moment, gasping for air through the T-shirt I had pulled up over my mouth, I could see vividly what it could become, the intimate dinner party I would throw every night in this charming, quirky space. I was already lighting the candles and filling the jelly jars with wine. I would cook there much the way I cooked at home: whole roasted veal breast and torn lettuces in a well-oiled wooden bowl, a ripe cheese after dinner, none of the aggressively \u201cconceptual\u201d or architectural food then trendy among aspirational chefs but also none of the roulades and miniaturized bites I\u2019d been cranking out as a freelancer in catering kitchens. At that point New York didn\u2019t have an ambitious and exciting restaurant on every block, in every unlikely neighborhood, operating out of impossibly narrow spaces. There was no Eater, no Instagram, no hipster Brooklyn food scene. If you wanted something expert to eat, you dined in Manhattan. For fine dining, with plush armchairs and a captain who ran your table wearing an Armani suit, you went uptown; for the buzzy American brasserie with bentwood cane-backed chairs and waiters in long white aprons, you stayed downtown. There was no serious restaurant that would allow a waiter to wear a flannel shirt or hire a sommelier with face piercings and neck tattoos. The East Village had Polish and Ukrainian diners, falafel stands, pizza parlors, dive bars and vegetarian cafes. There was only one notable noodle spot. Momofuku opened five years after Prune. I meant to create a restaurant that would serve as delicious and interesting food as the serious restaurants elsewhere in the city but in a setting that would welcome, and not intimidate, my ragtag friends and my neighbors \u2014 all the East Village painters and poets, the butches and the queens, the saxophone player on the sixth floor of my tenement building, the performance artists doing their brave naked work up the street at P.S. 122. I wanted a place you could go after work or on your day off if you had only a line cook\u2019s paycheck but also a line cook\u2019s palate. And I thought it might be a more stable way to earn a living than the scramble of freelancing I\u2019d done up until then. Like most chefs who own these small restaurants that have now proliferated across the whole city, I\u2019ve been driven by the sensory, the human, the poetic and the profane \u2014 not by money or a thirst to expand. Even after seven nights a week for two decades, I am still stopped in my tracks every time my bartenders snap those metal lids onto the cocktail shakers and start rattling the ice like maracas. I still close my eyes for a second, taking a deep inhale, every time the salted pistachios are set afire with raki, sending their anise scent through the dining room. I still thrill when the four-top at Table 9 are talking to one another so contentedly that they don\u2019t notice they are the last diners, lingering in the cocoon of the wine and the few shards of dark chocolate we\u2019ve put down with their check. Even though I can\u2019t quite take part in it myself \u2014 I\u2019m the boss, who must remain a little aloof from the crew \u2014 I still quietly thrum with satisfaction when the \u201ckids\u201d are chattering away and hugging one another their hellos and how-are-yous in the hallway as they get ready for their shifts. But the very first time you cut a payroll check, you understand quite bluntly that, poetic notions aside, you are running a business. And that crew of knuckleheads you adore are counting on you for their livelihood. In the beginning I was closed on Mondays, ran only six dinner shifts and paid myself $425 a week. I got a very positive review in The New York Times, and thereafter we were packed. When I added a seventh dinner in 2000, I was able to hire a full-time sous chef. When I added weekend brunch, which started as a dreamy idea, not a business plan, it wound up being popular enough to let me buy out all six of the original investors. I turned 43 in 2008 and finally became the majority owner of my restaurant. I made my last student-loan payment and started paying myself $800 a week. A few years later, when I added lunch service on weekdays, it was a business decision, not a dream, because I needed to be able to afford health insurance for my staff, and I knew I could make an excellent burger. So suddenly, there we were: 14 services, seven days a week, 30 employees. It was a thrilling and exhausting first 10 years with great momentum. But Prune at 20 is a different and reduced quantity, now that there are no more services to add and costs keep going up. It just barely banks about exactly what it needs each week to cover its expenses. I\u2019ve joked for years that I\u2019m in the nonprofit sector, but that has been more direly true for several years now. This past summer, at 53, in spite of having four James Beard Awards on the wall, an Emmy on the shelf from  our PBS program  and a best-selling book that has been translated into six languages, I found myself flat on my stomach on the kitchen floor in a painter\u2019s paper coverall suit, maneuvering a garden hose rigged up to the faucet. I\u2019d poured bleach and Palmolive and degreaser behind the range and the reach-ins, trying to blast out the deep, dark, unreachable corner of the saut\u00e9 station where lost egg shells, mussels, green scrubbies, hollow marrow bones, tasting spoons and cake testers, tongs and the occasional sizzle plate all get trapped and forgotten during service. There used to be enough extra money every year that I could close for 10 days in July to repaint and retile and rewire, but it has become increasingly impossible to leave even a few days of revenue on the table or to justify the expense of hiring a professional cleaning service for this deep clean that I am perfectly capable of doing myself, so I stayed late and did it after service. The sludge of egg yolk seeped through the coverall, through my clothes to my skin, matted my hair and speckled my goggles as my shock registered: It has always been hard, but when did it get  this  hard? Two weeks after  we closed, Ashley still had not got through to unemployment, and I had been thrice-thwarted by the auto-fill feature of the electronic form of the loan I was urged to apply for. I could start to see that things I had thought would be quick and uncomplicated would instead be steep and unyielding. No one was going to rescue me. I went into the empty restaurant for a bit each day to push back against the entropy \u2014 a light bulb had died, a small freezer needed to be unplugged and restarted. Eleven envelopes arrived, bearing the unemployment notices from the New York State Department of Labor. The next stack of five arrived a week later. And then another six. The line of credit I thought would be so easy to acquire turned out to be one long week of harsh busy signals before I was even able to apply on March 25. I was turned down a week later, on April 1, because of \u201cinadequate business and personal cash flow.\u201d I howled with laughter over the phone at the underwriter and his explanation. Everything was uphill. Twenty-one days after we closed, Ashley still hadn\u2019t been able to reach unemployment. They now had a new system to handle the overload of calls: You call based on the first letter of your last name, and her next possible day would be a Thursday. If she didn\u2019t get through, she would have to wait until the next day allotted for all the M\u2019s of the city. Links to low-interest S.B.A. disaster loans were circulated, but New York City wasn\u2019t showing up on the list of eligible zones. I emailed my accountant: This is weird? She wrote back with a sarcastic smiley emoticon:  I believe it will be updated. It\u2019s the government \u2014 they are only fast when they are collecting your taxes.  The James Beard Foundation kicked into high gear and announced meaningful grants of up to $15,000 and with an application period that was supposed to last from March 30 to April 3, but within hours of opening, it was overwhelmed with applications and it had to stop accepting more. Ashley texted me from home that our dog was limping severely. This was the scenario that made me sweat: a medical emergency. We could live for a month on what was in the freezer, and I had a credit card that still had a $13,000 spending limit, but what if we got hurt somehow and needed serious medical care? Neither of us was insured. My kids are covered under their father\u2019s policy, but there was no safety net for us. Among us chefs, there have been a hundred jokes over the decades about our medical (and veterinary) backup plans \u2014 given our latex gloves and razor-sharp knives and our spotless stainless-steel prep tables \u2014 but my sense of humor at that moment had become hard to summon. Meanwhile, my inbox was loaded with emails from everyone I\u2019ve ever known, all wanting to check in, as well as from colleagues around the country who were only now comprehending the scope of the impact on New York\u2019s restaurants. Hastily, fellow chefs and restaurant owners were forming groups, circulating petitions, quickly knitting coalitions for restaurant workers and suppliers and farmers. There were surveys to fill out, representatives to call, letters to sign. Some were turning their restaurants into meal kitchens to feed hospital workers. There was a relief bill before Congress that we were all urgently asked to support, but it puzzlingly left out small, independent restaurants even as it came through pretty nicely for huge chains and franchises. The other option, the Paycheck Protection Program, would grant you a loan with forgiveness, I learned, but only if you rehire your laid-off staff before the end of June. With no lifting of the mandatory shuttering and the Covid-19 death tolls still mounting, how could we rehire our staff? I couldn\u2019t really use the loan for what I needed: rent for the foreseeable future and the stack of invoices still haunting me in the office. And right when I started to feel backed against the ropes, I got a group email from a few concerned former Prune managers who eagerly offered to start a GoFundMe for Prune, inadvertently putting another obstacle in front of me: my own dignity. I sat on the email for a few days, roiling in a whole new paralysis of indecision. There were individual campaigns being run all over town to raise money to help restaurant staffs, but when I tried to imagine joining this trend, I couldn\u2019t overcome my pride at being seen as asking for a handout. It felt like a popularity contest or a survival-of-the-most-well-connected that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to enter. It would make me feel terrible if Prune was nicely funded while the Sikhs at the Punjabi Grocery and Deli down the street were ignored, and simultaneously crushed if it wasn\u2019t. I also couldn\u2019t quite imagine the ethical calculus by which I would distribute such funds: Should I split them equally, even though one of my workers is a 21-year-old who already owns his own apartment in Manhattan, while another lives with his unemployed wife and their two children in a rental in the Bronx? I thanked my former managers but turned them down: I had repeatedly checked in with my staff, and everybody was OK for now. It would be nigh impossible for me, in the context of a pandemic, to argue for the necessity of my existence. Do my sweetbreads and my Parmesan omelet count as essential at this time? In economic terms, I don\u2019t think I could even argue that Prune matters anymore, in a neighborhood and a city now fully saturated with restaurants much like mine, many of them better than mine \u2014 some of which have expanded to employ as many as 100 people, not just cooks and servers and bartenders but also human-resource directors and cookbook ghostwriters. I am not going to suddenly start arguing the merits of my restaurant as a vital part of an \u201cindustry\u201d or that I help to make up 2 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product or that I should be helped out by our government because I am one of those who employ nearly 12 million Americans in the work force. But those seem to be the only persuasive terms \u2014 with my banks, my insurers, my industry lobbyists and legislators. I have to hope, though, that we matter in some other alternative economy; that we are still a thread in the fabric that might unravel if you yanked us from the weave. Everybody\u2019s saying that restaurants  won\u2019t make it back, that we won\u2019t survive. I imagine this is at least partly true: Not all of us will make it, and not all of us will perish. But I can\u2019t easily discern the determining factors, even though thinking about which restaurants will survive \u2014 and why \u2014 has become an obsession these past weeks. What delusional mind-set am I in that I just do not feel that this is the end, that I find myself convinced that this is only a pause, if I want it to be? I don\u2019t carry investor debt; my vendors trust me; if my building\u2019s co-op evicted me, they would have a beast of a time getting a new tenant to replace me. But I know few of us will come back as we were. And that doesn\u2019t seem to me like a bad thing at all; perhaps it will be a chance for a correction, as my friend, the chef Alex Raij, calls it. The conversation about how restaurants will continue to operate, given the rising costs of running them has been ramping up for years now; the coronavirus did not suddenly shine light on an unknown fragility. We\u2019ve all known, and for a rather long time. The past five or six years have been alarming. For restaurants, coronavirus-mandated closures are like the oral surgery or appendectomy you suddenly face while you are uninsured. These closures will take out the weakest and the most vulnerable. But exactly who among us are the weakest and most vulnerable is not obvious. Since Prune opened in the East Village, the neighborhood has changed tremendously in ways that reflect, with exquisite perfection, the restaurant scene as a whole. Within a 10-block radius of my front door, we have the more-than-100-year-old institutions Russ & Daughters and Katz\u2019s Delicatessen. We have hole-in-the-wall falafel, bubble tea and dumpling houses, and there\u2019s a steakhouse whose chef also operates a restaurant in Miami. There\u2019s everyday sushi and rare, wildly expensive omakase sushi, as well as Japanese home cooking, udon specialists and soba shops. There\u2019s a woman-owned and woman-run restaurant with an economic-justice mission that has eliminated tipping. Bobby Flay, perhaps the most famous chef on the Food Network, has an 125-seater two avenues over. We have farm-to-table concepts every three blocks, a handful of major James Beard Award winners and a dozen more shortlisted nominees and an impressive showing of New York Times one- and two-star earners, including  Madame Vo , a knockout Vietnamese restaurant just a few years old. Marco Canora, who started the country\u2019s migration from regular old broth to what is now known by the name of his shop, Brodo, has published a couple of cookbooks and done a healthy bit of television in the course of his career. He still runs his only restaurant,  17-year-old Hearth , on First Avenue. But block after block, for so many years now, there are storefronts where restaurants turn over so quickly that I don\u2019t even register their names. If Covid-19 is the death of restaurants in New York, will we be able to tell which restaurants went belly up because of the virus? Or will they be the same ones that would have failed within 16 months of opening anyway, from lack of wherewithal or experience? When we are sorting through the restaurant obituaries, will we know for sure that it was not because the weary veteran chef decided, as I have often been tempted myself in these weeks, to quietly walk out the open back door of a building that has been burning for a long time? It gets so confusing. Restaurant operators had already become oddly cagey, and quick to display a false front with each other. You asked, \u201cHow\u2019s business?\u201d and the answer always was, \u201cYeah, great, best quarter we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d But then the coronavirus hits, and these same restaurant owners rush into the public square yelling: \u201cFire! Fire!\u201d They now reveal that they had also been operating under razor-thin margins. It instantly turns 180 degrees: Even famous, successful chefs, owners of empires, those with supremely wealthy investors upon whom you imagine they could call for capital should they need it, now openly describe in technical detail, with explicit data, how dire a position they are in. The sad testimony gushes out, confirming everything that used to be so convincingly denied. The concerns before coronavirus are still universal: The restaurant as we know it is no longer viable on its own. You can\u2019t have tipped employees making $45 an hour while line cooks make $15. You can\u2019t buy a $3 can of cheap beer at a dive bar in the East Village if the \u201cdive bar\u201d is actually paying $18,000 a month in rent, $30,000 a month in payroll; it would have to cost $10. I can\u2019t keep hosing down the saut\u00e9 corner myself just to have enough money to repair the ripped awning. Prune is in the East Village because I\u2019ve lived in the East Village for more than 30 years. I moved here because it was where you could get an apartment for $450 a month. In 1999, when I opened Prune, I still woke each morning to roosters crowing from the rooftop of the tenement building down the block, which is now a steel-and-glass tower. A less-than-500-square-foot studio apartment rents for $3,810 a month. The girl who called about brunch the first day we were closed probably lives there. She is used to having an Uber driver pick her up exactly where she stands at any hour of the day, a gel mani-pedi every two weeks and award-winning Thai food delivered to her door by a guy who braved the sleet, having attached oven mitts to his bicycle handlebars to keep his hands warm. But I know she would be outraged if charged $28 for a Bloody Mary. For the past 10 years I\u2019ve been staring wide-eyed and with alarm as the sweet, gentle citizen restaurant transformed into a kind of unruly colossal beast. The food world got stranger and weirder to me right while I was deep in it. The \u201cwaiter\u201d became the \u201cserver,\u201d the \u201crestaurant business\u201d became the \u201chospitality industry,\u201d what used to be the \u201ccustomer\u201d became the \u201cguest,\u201d what was once your \u201cpersonality\u201d became your \u201cbrand,\u201d the small acts of kindness and the way you always used to have of sharing your talents and looking out for others became things to \u201cmonetize.\u201d The work itself \u2014 cooking delicious, interesting food and cleaning up after cooking it \u2014 still feels as fresh and honest and immensely satisfying as ever. Our beloved regulars and the people who work so hard at Prune are all still my favorite people on earth. But maybe it\u2019s the bloat, the fetishistic foodies, the new demographic of my city who have never been forced to work in retail or service sectors. Maybe it\u2019s the auxiliary industries that feed off the restaurants themselves \u2014 the bloggers and agents and the \u201cinfluencers,\u201d the brand managers, the personal assistants hired just to keep you fresh on \u201cInsta,\u201d the Food & Wine festivals, the multitude of panels we chefs are now routinely invited to join, to offer our charming yet thoroughly unresearched opinions on. The proliferation of television shows and YouTube channels and culinary competitions and season after season of programming where you find yourself aghast to see an idol of yours stuffing packaged cinnamon buns into a football-shaped baking pan and squirting the frosting into a laces pattern for a tailgating episode on the Food Network. And God, the brunch, the brunch. The phone hauled out for every single pancake and every single Bloody Mary to be photographed and Instagrammed. That guy who strolls in and won\u2019t remove his sunglasses as he holds up two fingers at my hostess without saying a word: He wants a table for two. The purebred lap dogs now passed off as service animals to calm the anxieties that might arise from eating eggs Benedict on a Sunday afternoon. I want the girl who called the first day of our mandated shut down to call back, in however many months when restaurants are allowed to reopen, so I can tell her with delight and sincerity: No. We are not open for brunch. There is no more brunch. I, like hundreds  of other chefs across the city and thousands around the country, are now staring down the question of what our restaurants, our careers, our lives, might look like if we can even get them back. I don\u2019t know whom to follow or what to think. Everyone says: \u201cYou should do to-go! You should sell gift cards! You should offer delivery! You need a social media presence! You should pivot to groceries! You should raise your prices \u2014 a branzino is $56 at Via Carota!\u201d I have thought for many long minutes, days, weeks of confinement and quarantine, should I? Is that what Prune should do and what Prune should become? I cannot see myself excitedly daydreaming about the third-party delivery-ticket screen I will read orders from all evening. I cannot see myself sketching doodles of the to-go boxes I will pack my food into so that I can send it out into the night, anonymously, hoping the poor delivery guy does a good job and stays safe. I don\u2019t think I can sit around dreaming up menus and cocktails and fantasizing about what would be on my playlist just to create something that people will order and receive and consume via an app. I started my restaurant as a place for people to talk to one another, with a very decent but affordable glass of wine and an expertly prepared plate of simply braised lamb shoulder on the table to keep the conversation flowing, and ran it as such as long as I could. If this kind of place is not relevant to society, then it \u2014 we \u2014 should become extinct. And yet even with the gate indefinitely shut against the coronavirus, I\u2019ve been dreaming again, but this time I\u2019m not at home fantasizing about a restaurant I don\u2019t even yet have the keys to. This time I\u2019ve been sitting still and silent, inside the shuttered restaurant I already own, that has another 10 years on the lease. I spend hours inside each day, on a wooden chair, in the empty clean space with the windows papered up, and I listen to the coolers hum, the compressor click on and off periodically, the thunder that echoes up from the basement as the ice machine drops its periodic sheet of thick cubes into the insulated bin. My body has a thin blue thread of electricity coursing through it. Sometimes I rearrange the tables. For some reason, I can\u2019t see wanting deuces anymore: No more two-tops? What will happen come Valentine\u2019s Day? It\u2019s no mystery why this prolonged isolation has made me find the tiny 24-square-inch tables that I\u2019ve been cramming my food and my customers into for 20 years suddenly repellent. I want round tables, big tables, six-people tables, eight-tops. Early supper, home before midnight. Long, lingering civilized Sunday lunches with sun streaming in through the front French doors. I want old regulars to wander back into the kitchen while I lift the lids off the pots and show them what there is to eat. I want to bring to their tables small dishes of the feta cheese I\u2019ve learned to make these long idle weeks, with a few slices of the  saucisson sec  I\u2019ve been hanging downstairs to cure while we wait to reopen, and to again hear Greg rattle the ice, shaking perfectly proportioned Vespers that he pours right to the rim of the chilled glass without spilling over. I have been shuttered before. With no help from the government, Prune has survived 9/11, the blackout, Hurricane Sandy, the recession, months of a city water-main replacement, online reservations systems \u2014 you still have to call us on the telephone, and we still use a pencil and paper to take reservations! We\u2019ve survived the tyranny of convenience culture and the invasion of Caviar, Seamless and Grubhub. So I\u2019m going to let the restaurant sleep, like the beauty she is, shallow breathing, dormant. Bills unpaid. And see what she looks like when she wakes up \u2014 so well rested, young all over again, in a city that may no longer recognize her, want her or need her.",

    "title": "Opinion | McConnell to Every State: Drop Dead - The New York Times",
    "text": "Covid-19 has killed tens of thousands of Americans, and will clearly kill many more. The lockdown needed to contain the coronavirus is causing an economic slump several times as deep as the Great Recession. Yet this necessary slump doesn\u2019t have to be accompanied by severe financial hardship. We have the resources to ensure that every American has enough to eat, that people don\u2019t lose health insurance, that they don\u2019t lose their homes because they can\u2019t pay rent or mortgage fees. There\u2019s also no reason we should see punishing cuts in essential public services. Unfortunately, it\u2019s looking increasingly likely that tens of millions of Americans will in fact suffer extreme hardship and that there will be devastating cuts in services. Why? The answer mainly boils down to two words: Mitch McConnell. On Wednesday, McConnell, the Senate majority leader, declared that he is opposed to any further federal aid to beleaguered state and local governments, and suggested that states  declare bankruptcy  instead. Lest anyone accuse McConnell of being even slightly nonpartisan, his office distributed  two   memos  referring to proposals for state aid as \u201cblue state bailouts.\u201d A number of governors have already denounced McConnell\u2019s position as stupid, which it is. But it\u2019s also vile and hypocritical. When I say that we have the resources to avoid severe financial hardship, I\u2019m referring to the federal government, which can borrow vast sums very cheaply. In fact, the  interest rate  on inflation-protected bonds, which measure real borrowing costs, is  minus  0.43 percent: Investors are basically paying the feds to hold their money. So Washington can and should run big budget deficits in this time of need. State and local governments, however, can\u2019t, because almost all of them are required by law to run balanced budgets. Yet these governments, which are on the front line of dealing with the pandemic, are facing a combination of collapsing revenue and soaring expenses. The obvious answer is federal aid. But McConnell wants states and cities to declare bankruptcy instead. This is, as I said, stupid on multiple levels. For one thing, states don\u2019t even have the legal right to declare bankruptcy; even if they somehow managed all the same to default on their relatively small debts, it would do little to alleviate their financial distress \u2014 although it could cause a national financial crisis. Oh, and the idea that this is specifically a blue state problem is ludicrous. Fiscal crises are looming all across America, from  Florida  to  Kansas  to  Texas  \u2014 hit especially hard by crashing oil prices \u2014 to, yes, McConnell\u2019s home state,  Kentucky . And if states and local governments are forced into sharp budget cuts, the effect will be to deepen the economic slump \u2014 which would be bad for Donald Trump and could cost Republicans the Senate. So yes, McConnell\u2019s position is stupid. But it\u2019s also vile. Think of who would be hurt if state and local governments are forced to make drastic cuts. A lot of state money goes to Medicaid, a program that should be expanding, not shrinking, as millions of Americans are  losing their health insurance  along with their jobs. As for the state and local government workers who may be either losing their jobs or facing pay cuts,  most are  employed in education, policing, firefighting and highways. So if McConnell gets his way, America\u2019s de facto policy will be one of bailing out the owners of giant restaurant chains while firing schoolteachers and police officers. Last but not least, let\u2019s talk about McConnell\u2019s hypocrisy, which like his stupidity comes on multiple levels. At one level, it\u2019s really something to see a man who helped ram through a giant tax cut for corporations \u2014 which they mainly used to buy back their own stock \u2014 now pretend to be deeply concerned about borrowing money to help states facing a fiscal crisis that isn\u2019t their fault. At another level, it\u2019s also really something to see McConnell, whose state is heavily subsidized by the federal government, give lectures on self-reliance to states like New York that pay much more in federal taxes than they get back. We\u2019re not talking about small numbers here. According to estimates by the  Rockefeller Institute , from 2015 to 2018 Kentucky \u2014 which pays relatively little in federal taxes, because it\u2019s fairly poor, but gets major benefits from programs like Medicare and Social Security \u2014 received net transfers from Washington averaging more than $33,000 per person. That was 18.6 percent of the  state\u2019s G.D.P . True, relatively rich states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut probably should be helping out their poorer neighbors \u2014 but those neighbors don\u2019t then get the right to complain about \u201cblue state bailouts\u201d in the face of a national disaster. Of course, McConnell has an agenda here: He\u2019s hoping to use the pandemic to force afflicted states to shrink their governments. We can only hope both that this shameless exploitation of tragedy fails and that McConnell and his allies pay a heavy political price.

    "title": "Opinion | No Death Sentences for Minor Offenses - The New York Times",
    "text": "On March 28,  Patrick Jones  became the first inmate in a federal prison known to have died   of Covid-19. He was a worker at a prison textile factory at the Oakdale Federal Correctional Complex in Louisiana, where he was serving time for a nonviolent drug offense. By the third week of April, seven more inmates at Oakdale had died. Meanwhile, prison factories around the country have  stayed open , subjecting inmates who work there to packed conditions even as the virus spreads. Social distancing in prisons is nearly impossible. The size of the inmate population in federal prisons exceeds their rated capacity by 12 to 19 percent, according to a  report  this year from the Justice Department. No one deserves to die of Covid-19 in prison or jail. But  more than 100 inmates already have , and thousands more could if prisons and elected officials do not take steps to protect the incarcerated now. A report from the American Civil Liberties Union predicted that an explosion of cases in jails could cause the total death count in the United States  to double . Two weeks ago, Cook County Jail in Chicago was the nation\u2019s top hot spot for coronavirus cases,  according to The Times . More than 230 inmates and 115 staff members had tested positive, even as the majority of inmates had not been tested. This week, the  Marion Correctional Institution  in Ohio became the largest reported source of virus infections. There,  2,011 inmates , about 80 percent of the prison\u2019s population, have tested positive. In addition, 154 members of the 350-person staff tested positive. In total, at least 2,400 inmates in Ohio\u2019s prison system have tested positive. Ten have died in Ohio\u2019s Pickaway Correctional Institution, which houses minimum- and medium-security inmates. Infection hot spots appearing in prisons is not a fait accompli. The spread of the virus can be curbed if prisons send home eligible inmates. The federal government and 49 states already recognize some form of  compassionate release  for the elderly and very ill. If ever there were a time to show compassion to vulnerable, nonviolent inmates, it is now. Parole boards in states with indeterminate sentencing also have the power to assess the list of inmates set to be paroled in the next six months and to consider releasing many of them as soon as possible. Some states have already taken action to free inmates. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington this week commuted the sentences of 293 inmates whose release was set to come within 60 days. In Washington, another 600 inmates are  reportedly  being considered for a \u201crapid re-entry program\u201d that would allow freed inmates to re-enter the community with electronic monitoring. Governors across the country should evaluate ways to use their clemency powers to save lives. Releasing these prisoners during this crisis is not just an act of mercy to protect prisoners\u2019 health, and the health of the prison staff. Fewer sick inmates means less strain on the already burdened prison hospital system. The system was ill equipped to provide proper care to the elderly and sick even before this crisis. A 2016  report  from the Department of Justice found that 17 percent of medical positions in prison hospitals were unfilled, and that 12 Bureau of Prisons facilities were so understaffed that they were at \u201ccrisis level.\u201d Releasing high-risk inmates will free up limited resources within the prison health care system to better treat those who remain. A 2016  study  from the Brennan Center for Justice found that there was no compelling public safety reason to incarcerate 39 percent of the inmates in state and federal prisons, about 576,000 people. Elderly Americans are especially unlikely to commit further crimes once released. The United States Sentencing Commission  found  in 2017 that offenders over the age of 65 had just a 13.4 percent chance of being rearrested in an eight-year period after release, compared to a 67.6 percent chance for those under age 21. The report concluded that \u201crecidivism measured by rearrest, reconviction, and reincarceration declined as age increased.\u201d There are more than 10,000 people over the age of 61 in federal prison. Many elderly inmates have been in prison for decades after receiving  long sentences in the tough-on-crime 1990s . Many would be good candidates for compassionate release now. If prisons are unwilling to release some inmates outright, they could send eligible people into home confinement, at least for the duration of this crisis. Attorney General William Barr has the authority under   the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act to expand the authority of the Bureau of Prisons to send people into home confinement. He has already  ordered the Bureau of Prisons  to make more inmates at federal facilities eligible for home confinement, prioritizing those at federal facilities with outbreaks of the coronavirus in Louisiana, Connecticut and Ohio. State and local prisons should follow suit. State officials should also work together to limit the number of new inmates entering prisons during this crisis. Prosecutors can turn their focus away from low-level crimes. The police can issue citations for nonviolent crimes instead of arresting people. Governors can issue moratoriums on cash bail, ensuring that people do not get placed in overcrowded facilities just because they cannot afford to pay. That is a bad policy in normal times, and possibly a fatal one during this crisis. When the pandemic has passed, there will be an opportunity for broader criminal justice reforms. But in the very short term, while inmates and staff members are dying, prisons need to release people immediately. The Times is committed to publishing  a diversity of letters  to the editor.

    "title": "What to Do When Mom Believes Coronavirus Conspiracies - The New York Times",
    "text": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can  sign up here  to receive it weekdays. It\u2019s not unusual for my relatives or friends to talk about kooky ideas. But now others\u2019 believing in hoaxes or bad information feels dangerous. This  drug is a miracle cure !  Blame this billionaire  for the virus! I tried to figure out what we can do when someone we love believes in coronavirus conspiracies they see online. What I learned is we need to have empathy for people who are afraid of a scary illness. We should be on the lookout for those who have reasons to talk up misinformation. And with  trust in authority figures falling  among many Americans, we can step in and spread good information to people who trust us and model good behavior. \u201cConspiracy theories seem especially likely to take hold during disasters and tragedies when people experience a loss of control and are trying to make sense of the world,\u201d said  Brendan Nyhan , a Dartmouth College professor who studies misperceptions about politics and health care. Nyhan said the worst thing you can do is shame people in your social circle for what they believe. Don\u2019t be too hard on your cousin who posts that  cellphone towers contribute to coronavirus infections . Don\u2019t be  that lobbyist who typed \u201cIDIOTS\u201d  about people protesting stay-at-home orders. We\u2019re fallible. Sometimes we worry about the wrong things. Reasonable people can disagree, particularly when knowledge about this virus keeps shifting. We also need to train ourselves and our loved ones to look behind the curtain for  people with a political message  and others who have incentives to fan our fears in crises, said  Ren\u00e9e DiResta , who researches disinformation at the Stanford Internet Observatory. But Nyhan said it\u2019s counterproductive to spend too much energy trying to refute people we disagree with, whether it\u2019s  friends , talking heads on television or politicians. If we put all our attention on misinformation, he said, \u201cthe communication becomes too focused on what\u2019s not true rather than what is.\u201d Instead, he said it\u2019s better to amplify accurate messages. Nyhan credited  sports stars like Steph Curry , health care officials and entertainers who helped spread the message that the coronavirus was dangerous and that people could best protect themselves by staying home as much as possible and keeping their distance from people outside their households. Like those celebrities, we can spread helpful information to people who believe what we say. Nyhan and DiResta, who has written extensively about misinformation about vaccines, said they were worried that fear-mongering or a lack of trust in government authorities will undermine a potential coronavirus vaccine. We might be able to help there, too. Maybe your brother doesn\u2019t trust the C.D.C., Nyhan said, but he probably does trust you, his kid\u2019s school principal and his church deacon. They should tout the importance of vaccines. Someone in our lives relies on us. And we can harness that trust to help keep ourselves informed and our communities safe. We talked in Wednesday\u2019s newsletter  about people\u2019s mixed experiences shopping on Amazon in this pandemic. There\u2019s evidence that many are shopping more than usual at places other than Amazon. After years of Americans devoting bigger chunks of our online spending to Amazon, we are shifting in the other direction for now. Out of every dollar that Americans spent shopping online in the week ending April 10, about 35.5 cents was on Amazon. Until then, Amazon was getting about 40 to 44 cents of each online spending dollar, according to the market research firm Rakuten Intelligence. It\u2019s hard to know exactly why. Companies like Home Depot and especially Target, plus the groceries delivery service Instacart, are getting more of our online dollars than they typically do, Rakuten figures show. It may be because  we\u2019re buying more groceries , which people don\u2019t tend to buy on Amazon. Or Amazon\u2019s  shortages and shipping delays  may be turning some people off. Amazon\u2019s delivery times, which had been hovering around two days on average, went as high as four days in mid-March, Rakuten said. Delivery speeds have started to fall back down. Shipping times of other companies, which usually take longer to deliver than Amazon, also slowed down. Fun fact: Before this pandemic, about 85 percent of Americans\u2019 retail spending still happened in physical stores. If this crisis makes us shop online more, Amazon will be a big winner. But more competition might make everyone try harder for our money. When the boss cares about the details again:  After years of focusing on the big picture, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has  dived back into day-to-day company management  during the pandemic, my colleague  Karen Weise  reports. Bezos is participating in daily calls about product inventory, obsessing about coronavirus testing and is getting involved in Amazon\u2019s response to public criticism. Is Twitter good now ?  That\u2019s what a trio of my smart and hilarious colleagues debated. Personally, if my options are: scroll Twitter, wash my endless pile of dishes or have an honest thought about my own fears \u2026 then TWITTER IT IS. TikTok is influencing how musicians title their songs.  To make sure people can search for their songs online,  musicians are changing vague titles  like \u201cily\u201d to match the snippets of lyrics people hear on TikTok, Rolling Stone writes. Dance routines on the short-video app are where many people discover new music. Also: You gotta applaud the  creativity of teenagers remaking prom on TikTok . Look at  these girls ! Bob Ross petting a baby deer . That\u2019s it. Just watch it.

    "title": "Brazil coronavirus: Limits on testing hide cases, deaths - The Washington Post",
    "text": "Atop a shaded hill at the edge of S\u00e3o Paulo, the gravedigger thinks he knows the truth. No matter how bad it appears in Brazil \u2014 the country hit hardest by the  coronavirus  in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 the reality is significantly worse. Manoel Norberto Pereira watched another body being wheeled in, accompanied by what has by now become a familiar set of details. Sex: Female. Age: 77 years. Cause of death: Insufficient respiration. Every day brings more. The cemetery now receives around 50 bodies every day \u2014 double the average in normal times. Many are marked as confirmed cases of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. But many more say only unidentified respiratory ailment. To Pereira, they\u2019re the unseen toll of the coronavirus in Brazil, which has officially infected 45,000 people and killed 2,900 \u2014 but unofficially many times more than that. Public health experts: Coronavirus could overwhelm the developing world Imprecise and insufficient testing is a global problem, but in Brazil, it\u2019s on an entirely different scale. Latin America\u2019s largest country is testing people at a rate far lower than any other nation with at least 40,000 cases. It tests 12 times fewer people than Iran. Thirty-two times fewer than the United States. Hospitalized patients aren\u2019t being tested. Some medical professionals aren\u2019t being tested. People are dying in their homes without being tested. The undercount has undercut pleas for social isolation and empowered skeptics such as  Jair Bolsonaro . Brazil\u2019s president dismisses the pandemic as a \u201cfantasy\u201d driven by \u201ca little flu.\u201d Bolsonaro said this month that the numbers \u201clooked like the virus is starting to leave.\u201d Then, last week, he fired his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who had repeatedly and publicly contradicted the president on the severity of the crisis. \u201cUndercounting empowers populists to say, \u2018See, things are not that bad,\u2019 \u201d said Pedro Doria, former executive editor of the Brazilian newspaper O Globo. \u201cThere is a huge effort by the federal government to deny the gravity of the pandemic.\u201d Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access. Now Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters are gathering in city streets to amplify his calls to reopen the economy \u2014 while data scientists are saying the problem is drastically worse than they realize. Researchers at the Federal University of Minas Gerais have suggested Brazil has eight times more coronavirus cases than the official numbers. A research team at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo thinks it has 16 times more \u2014 as many as 711,000 cases. According to government statistics, nearly 37,300 people have been hospitalized this year with respiratory ailments \u2014 four times the number at this point last year \u2014 but only half have received test results. In S\u00e3o Paulo, nearly 1,300 people  have died of unidentified respiratory problems , compared with 50 people last year. Amazonas state has reported 193 deaths from covid-19. But its capital city is burying so many people \u2014 three times the average \u2014 that it\u2019s digging trenches for mass graves. Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro, channeling Trump, dismisses coronavirus measures \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2018a little cold\u2019 \u201cThe big conclusion is that we don\u2019t know what the real scenario is,\u201d said Leonardo Costa Ribeiro, an economist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \u201cIt gives the sensation that it is more controlled, when the reality is very different.\u201d Domingos Alves, a data scientist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, did little to hide his anger at the chasm between how government officials talk about the virus and what the data shows. \u201cAs a researcher, I look at the data and make analyses for the government,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a citizen, I\u2019m frustrated. The government is trying to control the epidemic without the elements of how to control it because they don\u2019t know how serious it is. \u201cIt will get much worse. There will be lines at the hospitals. There will be lines at the cemeteries. The next few weeks will be very dark.\u201d New Health Minister Nelson Teich, named by Bolsonaro to replace Mandetta, has made increased testing a pillar of the country\u2019s response to the pandemic. He said this week the government intends to purchase 46 million tests, enough for just over a fifth of the population. He hasn\u2019t specified when the tests will arrive or when they\u2019ll be used. \u201cWe are not talking about testing the entire country,\u201d Teich said. \u201cWe are going to use the tests so that people tested will reflect the Brazilian population.\u201d But the obstacles will be enormous \u2014 and could portend the struggles that await much of the developing world as the coronavirus moves deeper into Latin America and Africa. A variable as basic as reliable data could become a distinguishing factor between poor and wealthy countries. Analysts say Brazil has neither the manufacturing nor the purchasing capacity to meet the demand for tests. Its laboratories, already overwhelmed by a testing backlog, aren\u2019t equipped to process them at scale. And in the international scrum for supplies and testing equipment, the country is losing out to wealthier nations that can pay more or leverage closer ties with China. Brazil\u2019s densely packed favelas brace for coronavirus: \u2018It will kill a lot of people\u2019 \u201cBrazil could be thought of as a barometer of what could be expected in other countries,\u201d said Marcelo Gomes, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a scientific institution. \u201cInformation is paramount. The more we have, the more we can make the population aware of what it is exactly that we are facing.\u201d Without that information, said Paulo Buss, one of Brazil\u2019s preeminent public health experts, \u201cthe consequences are clear.\u201d The consequences were clear last month for Bruna Marques, a 24-year-old woman in S\u00e3o Paulo state. Her mother, diabetic, asthmatic and pregnant, had become so sick she could barely stand. She was having difficulty breathing. Her temperature had risen to 104 degrees. Two hospitals turned her away without testing for the virus. The third, 30 minutes away, finally admitted her. But within days, she was dead, the baby was lost and the funeral was over. Marques stood over her mother\u2019s grave, furious. All around, she said, were other families, equally mystified by the sudden deaths of loved ones. The hospital told Marques her mother had died of acute respiratory failure, she said. For weeks afterward, she said, she has called daily, asking if it was covid-19. But she never heard anything. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t even wait for me to say my mother\u2019s name before hanging up,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody tells me what really happened to her. It was all very fast, and we just wanted an answer. It\u2019s inhumane.\u201d A gravedigger at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Vila Formosa Cemetery, one of Latin America\u2019s largest, said he started noticing strange deaths in early March \u2014 weeks before Brazil\u2019s first confirmed coronavirus death. The causes of death \u2014 pneumonia, respiratory failure \u2014 were what he would expect to see during the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s winter, not peak summer. As coronavirus fears grow, doctors and nurses face abuse, attacks \u201cOne day, I saw on the news that in all of S\u00e3o Paulo there had been 20 burials of coronavirus victims,\u201d said the man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he didn\u2019t have permission to give an interview. \u201cBut I knew at my cemetery alone, there had been 27.\u201d Pereira feels the same frustration. Some days, he can\u2019t believe the number of people out in the street. If they were seeing what he saw, no way would they be outside. No way would there be a national debate over reopening the economy. No one would be listening to claims that the pandemic had been overblown. Bodies don\u2019t lie, he said. And here came another one. Sex: Male. Age: 100. Cause of death: Insufficient respiration. U.S. allies, encouraged by Washington, said goodbye to their Cuban doctors. As coronavirus surges, some are arguing for their return.

    "title": "My Money: 'The alcohol bill has increased, but he's earned it!' - BBC News",
    "text": "My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here, Claire Millington, an auditor for PwC, from West Yorkshire in the UK, takes us through a week in her life, as the country goes through the coronavirus pandemic. Claire (35) is mother to Alexander (4) and married to Luke. She lives halfway between Todmorden (pronounced Tod-m-dun not Tod-mor-den!) and Hebden Bridge. Over to Claire... I'm working full time from home now whereas my normal pattern would be two days at home and two days in the office. So, because of that and the fact that the munchkin is watching more TV than normal because he is not at preschool, we are spending a bit more on gas and electricity.  Childcare - we use the Government's Tax-Free Childcare system so whatever we pay in, the Treasury tops up by 20%. Our preschool charges a month's fees in advance so today I make the payment for 80% of the c\u00a3400 cost into my online Tax-Free Childcare account. It's a bit galling as the preschool is closed now, even to key worker children (we qualify due to the hubby's career) but I do understand that they will need the cash to tide them over until the Government's 80% furlough cash comes in.  Fortunately, we can afford to pay this as I am still working as normal, just from home, and the hubby is still on full employment, though he is currently stood down from his normal duties and is at home with us. While I'm pleased the staff are going to get paid, I know this is really difficult for some of the other parents who are really going to struggle this month. Hopefully there will be some sort of compromise/refund agreement once this is all over. Total spend: \u00a3320 Isolation saving (\u00a317)  \u00a312 train fare plus \u00a35 lunch as when I am in the office I frequently forget to make lunch, or if I do I have a bad habit of rushing out the door to get munchkin to preschool and leaving it in the fridge! Hooray for payday! Another quiet day, me working from home with the odd break to relieve daddy daycare. In order to do some baking with the munchkin later on in the week, we made a socially-distant visit to our neighbours to buy some eggs. They have a fabulous small holding of goats, sheep and chickens and I think we are their best customers. Especially when the hubby is at home, we go through eggs like nobody's business! Phone bill paid via direct debit. I eventually needed a new handset a couple of months ago so upped my contract to  \u00a323  per month from the  \u00a313  tariff I was on as I'd worked out that over the duration of the contract (24 months) I'd only be paying roughly the same as buying a new handset separately. Total spend: \u00a326 Isolation savings: \u00a30 The hubby has been taking the opportunity to finally build the compost heap (it's only been waiting for months\u2026) so we needed a delivery from our local builder's merchants costing around  \u00a342 . It's a big one today as the mortgage payment of around  \u00a31400  comes out on the first of each month. It never fails to make me gulp but it's worth it. We love our house and are doing what our mortgage adviser recommended - pay off as much as you can as quickly as you can and if you can afford it, overpay when you can. This means we save massive amounts of interest over the life of the mortgage and should (fingers crossed) be mortgage-free by the time we are 50. Total spend: \u00a31,442 Isolation saving: \u00a317  \u00a312 train fare and \u00a35 lunch. More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series: I do try to make sure that the majority of my bills are paid via direct debit (It's a condition of my current account and makes sure I don't miss a payment) and that they come out at the start of each month. That way I know that except for childcare and my phone bill, the rest of the cash is ours to do with as we please. So today is a bill day of nearly  \u00a3300  covering council tax, electricity, gas and water. As we have a septic tank our water costs are minimal each month as we don't pay for sewerage but we do save up a little each month to cover the cost of emptying the septic tank should it need it. Total spend: \u00a3300 Isolation saving: \u00a30 Friday is normally the day for planning the meals for the week ahead, doing the food shopping, doing housework and generally sorting my life out while the munchkin is at preschool (I'm contracted to do four days a week and do try to be strict with myself and not do anything other than check the work phone for emergency emails from my team on a Friday). Fortunately we had done our monthly big Costco shop for stuff such as toilet roll, kitchen roll, tinned food etc. before the lockdown started. This week it has been fresh food, meat and some treats as well as additional baking supplies as I have really enjoyed the cake-making with the munchkin. We are also trying to support our local small businesses, so where possible we are buying from the local butcher and grocer. This is slightly more expensive but as the butcher has award-winning produce (his Italian sausages are to die for) it's worth it.  There has also been a bit of an increase in the alcohol bill this week but looking at the hubby's face after a week of full-time entertaining our very active and demanding four-year-old I think he's earned it! Normally the hubby lives and works away during the week so while my weekly food shopping bill has gone up, this is probably just offset by what he is not spending on food when he is away. I'll call that a net draw - no pain but no gain either. Total spend: \u00a3150 Isolation saving: \u00a30 We are really lucky where we live that we have an acre of paddock (no horses though - my budget isn't quite up to that kind of hit!) so there is plenty of space in the garden and the paddock for the munchkin to run around and drive his toy JCB dump truck. We also look out onto Stoodley Pike (pronounced Studley) so it's really easy for us to get out and about in the fresh air for free.  Normally on a weekend we'd have taken a day trip out somewhere when the weather is nice but we are following the rules #stayhome. We did treat ourselves to a takeaway given we'd done such a long walk and got back a little later than planned. Sadly our favourite local Indian has closed to protect their staff and customers but a member of our local community has stepped up to help bring local information together in one place by creating a community website so we were able to find one that was still open.  Total spend: \u00a330 Isolation saving:  Hard to judge as our day trips out can vary in cost. When we do go out I always pack a lunch and drinks but we often end up paying for parking and then a coffee and cake. I've gone with an average of  \u00a325 . I took the weekly readings from the smart meter which came out at  \u00a334.50  for gas and  \u00a320.39  for electricity. While this is slightly more than normal, probably not helped by all the additional cups of coffee I am making while working from home the additional two days, it doesn't seem massively different. Thankfully the weather has been reasonably good with only a couple of cooler days this week. Had this been in the depths of winter it would have been a different story. Today was also the day I checked the digital banking to make sure all the direct debits for the bills had been paid. I was pleased to see that my gym has done what they promised and suspended all membership fees until they can reopen. So that's a  \u00a326  per month isolation saving, though I am having to make a special effort to do some of the free home workouts which is not as easy as people make out - I lack all enthusiasm when trying to do this in my living room! I also make sure that the standing order I have into my son's account is made. This is  \u00a3100  as a rule each month but then, towards the end of the month when I assess what money we can transfer to our savings, I may top this up with more if we can manage it. I want to make sure that he has funds for when he is older, either for university or for a house or even as funds to start a business. It may not be much but it does all add up over the years. As he has a higher interest children's saving account, assuming the rate of interest stayed the same at its current 3%,  \u00a3100  per month for the next 14 years (until he is 18) could be worth around  \u00a320,000 . Total spend: \u00a3154.89 Isolation saving: \u00a36.50.  As the gym membership is per month I've divided this by four to get an average weekly saving. While this week's spend might look horrific, it's worth noting that this is practically all our monthly spending in one week. With the exception of our weekly food shop, my phone bill and the cost of childcare, all our bills are paid in the few days after the start of the month. We then know that whatever money we have left is ours to do with as we wish - spend it or save it. That really helps give clarity and means we don't spend beyond our means. With having to stay closer to home we have made some savings, and not commuting to Manchester two days a week has made a difference to travel costs this week. The additional costs for electricity, gas and food are noticeable but not actually as much as I thought they would be.  I am just so thankful that where we are we have fabulous outdoor space where we can keep the munchkin busy, ourselves exercised and make sure we can stop ourselves from going stir crazy! Here's to hoping that this all ends soon and that people can stay safe and well. We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email  my.money@bbc.co.uk  or get in touch via our  My Money (World) Facebook group , or if you live in the UK, please join our  My Money (UK) Facebook group  and we'll aim to contact you.",

    "title": "Live N.F.L. Draft Round 1 Tracker and Updates - The New York Times",
    "text": "Every move the Buccaneers make revolves around maximizing their window with a quarterback who turns 43 in August. Tampa Bay traded up one spot, taking the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 pick, so they could draft an offensive lineman to  help protect Tom Brady. Tristan Wirfs should help. His diverse athletic background \u2014 his past in wrestling, in particular \u2014 informed his approach to playing offensive tackle. An absolute mauler in the run game and a reliable pass-blocker, Wirfs played mostly right tackle at Iowa and ceded only 40 quarterback pressures on 1,138 pass-blocking snaps at Iowa, according to Pro Football Focus.  \u201cIn wrestling, you need footwork, you need balance, awareness, body control \u2014 all that translates to offensive line,\u201d Wirfs said in a recent interview. \u201cYou don\u2019t get into big scrambles like you do in wrestling on the offensive line, but you still can get out of sorts and get your center of gravity off-kilter. To find that center of gravity and hopefully finish a block, it\u2019s just like putting a guy on his back in wrestling.\u201d In a draft class loaded with premier offensive tackles, and playing a position reserved for the most powerful of dudes, Wirfs manages to stand out. He won three consecutive state titles in the discus, two in the shot put and one in wrestling, in the 285-pound weight class, in addition to playing football.  Wirfs\u2019s mother, Sarah, raised him and his sister, Kaylia, rushing to their athletic pursuits after her shift at Target, where she has worked for 28 years (naturally, his favorite job of his mother\u2019s was in the bakery, since she would bring home snacks). Just before the draft began, he invited Sarah to walk a makeshift red carpet in front of their home, to acknowledge her support.  For the  Raiders, which open a new stadium in their new home of Las Vegas  this season, the priority has to be upgrading the receiving talent around quarterback Derek Carr. Henry Ruggs III from Alabama fits the bill. Ruggs ran a 4.27, 40-yard dash at combine, the fastest of any position \u2014 and the third-fastest ever at the event since electronic timing was introduced in 1999. At Alabama, he was more of a deep threat, averaging 17.5 yards a reception, as the speedy complement to Jerry Jeudy. Ruggs III was also a kick returner his freshman and junior years. His mom, Nataki, ran track in Kansas, and she has said that she ran a 4.23 during a workout once. \u201cIf you ask me, she never ran that time,\u201d Ruggs said at the combine. \u201cI knew she was pretty fast. She used to run in the neighborhood, run against guys all the time and beat them. And we used to race when I was young \u2014 but I was young. I was small, didn\u2019t have long legs, didn\u2019t really know too much about running. Her track background helped her out when we were racing to the car at the grocery store, stuff like that. But ultimately, she\u2019ll tell you that she\u2019s not faster than me. Maybe in her prime, she felt like it. But \u2026 no.\u201d Like the Giants, the Jets very much need an anchor at offensive tackle to protect their young quarterback, as well as pass-rush help. The Jets allowed 52 sacks last season, the fourth-most in the N.F.L. Mekhi Becton should help. His large frame and consistent play at both right and left tackle made him a star at Louisville. He started 10 games at right tackle as a junior, 12 more as a sophomore, including 10 of them at left tackle. His junior season, he started 11 games at left tackle and was named first-team all-ACC. The Jets appear unconcerned about a report by  Ian Rapoport of NFL Network  who said Becton\u2019s drug test at the combine was flagged, though it isn\u2019t clear what rule he might have violated. The son of a transportation supervisor and a caterer (\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so big,\u201d he said at the scouting combine), Becton ran the fastest 40-yard dash (5.1) for a player his size since 2006. In ninth grade, he shot up five inches, to 6-foot-5, and when his doctor told his mother, Semone, that his growth plate was still open \u2014 he wasn\u2019t done growing yet \u2014 she was stunned. The hardest part, she told the Louisville Courier-Journal, was buying him clothes: \u201cWithin a couple months, they\u2019re high-waters. You buy these nice tennis shoes, then he skips a size and you have to pass them on to someone else.\u201d He does want to lose about 10-15 pounds, to play around 350-355, in the N.F.L., where his nimble feet and unadulterated power would allow him to play either tackle position. Also, he can dunk. The Browns use this opportunity to finally fill the left tackle spot that Joe Thomas vacated when he retired three years ago. At Alabama, Jedrick Wills Jr. anchored the right side of the offensive line for two years, allowing only one sack and three-and-a-half quarterback hurries on 714 snaps last season. He played in 11 games in his first season, then replaced Matt Womack at right tackle the following year, when he started all 15 games. His stature grew last season, when he was voted second-team all-American and first-team all-SEC while starting all 13 games at right tackle. In Cleveland, he\u2019ll likely switch to the left side to protect Baker Mayfield\u2019s blind side. Jack Conklin will probably anchor the right side. Born to a basketball family \u2014 his father coaches at his high school, in Lexington, Ky., and his mom played at Eastern Kentucky \u2014 Wills started walking at five months old, his mother once said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do a lot of crawling. He was big and strong and stout, and he just got up one day and took off.\u201d Guess what? He\u2019s still big and strong and stout. Was it just three seasons ago that the Jaguars, buoyed by a snarling defense,  reached the A.F.C. championship game ? That defense is unrecognizable now, having been disassembled in fits and spurts, but especially this off-season, when cornerback A.J. Bouye, defensive end Calais Campbell and defensive tackle Marcell Dareus all departed. With edge-rusher Yannick Ngakoue angling for a trade, the Jaguars focused on that side of the ball. C.J. Henderson   has the speed and anticipation to erase receivers all over the field, and his athleticism is absurd; according to  Bruce Feldman of The Athletic , Henderson bench presses 380 pounds and squats 545. Henderson can play multiple techniques, man and off, and over the last two seasons, he yielded just 20 receptions, on 44 targets, in single coverage on the boundary, according to Pro Football Focus, making him a prime candidate to start there as a rookie. Daniel Jeremiah, NFL Network\u2019s draft honcho, said in a recent conference call that Henderson has more upside than the consensus top corner, Jeff Okudah of Ohio State, but he must improve his tackling and consistency playing the ball downfield. The Cardinals\u2019 most obvious deficiency was along the offensive line, but then again, no team allowed more yards last season than they did, making overall defense a priority in this draft. Arizona shored up its defense by selecting  Isaiah Simmons , who can play anywhere and everywhere on that side of the ball. According to Pro Football Focus, Simmons, listed at 6-foot-4 and 238 pounds, played at least 100 snaps at five positions \u2014 slot cornerback, edge rusher, linebacker and both safety spots \u2014 and finished with 16\u00bd tackles for a loss, eight sacks, eight pass deflections and three interceptions. \u201cIn a league that doesn\u2019t have a lot of margin for error when it comes to roster management, I think you immediately get more than one person,\u201d Brent Venables, his defensive coordinator at Clemson, said in a recent interview. Simmons counterbalances the raft of hybridized offensive players permeating the N.F.L. He has the build, speed and length to counter players like San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle and Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey, who often cause mismatches. Modern defenses prioritize pressuring the quarterback and stopping the pass, and Simmons can do both. Coming from the college ranks, new Panthers coach Matt Rhule, who was at Baylor, might have a slight advantage \u2014 but what is he looking for? As it happens, Rhule wanted the best defensive lineman in the Southeastern Conference, if not the country. From his size to his post-football aspirations, there is nothing remotely tiny about  Derrick Brown  \u2014 nicknamed Baby Barack at Auburn. Brown measured 6-foot-5 and 326 pounds at the scouting combine in February. In college, he devoted himself to helping others, on campus and in the community, serving on leadership councils, building homes in the Dominican Republic and working at food banks. On the field, Brown thwarted triple-teams, mauled quarterbacks and stuffed running lanes. Rodney Garner, who coaches Auburn\u2019s defensive line, likened Brown to an amalgam of two N.F.L. stars he tutored at Georgia. Brown, he said, has the athleticism of Richard Seymour and the power of Marcus Stroud. \u201cCoaching Derrick Brown was easy,\u201d Garner said in a recent interview. \u201cIn my 31 years, I\u2019ve coached some really good defensive linemen. It\u2019s been a blessing. And he\u2019s right there at the top of the list.\u201d The Panthers are in the midst of an  organizational reboot under owner David A. Tepper,  who took over the team in 2018. Gone are former league M.V.P. Cam Newton and the winningest coach in franchise history, Ron Rivera. And after losing stalwarts at all three levels of the defense \u2014 lineman Gerald McCoy,  linebacker Luke Kuechly  and cornerback James Bradberry \u2014 certainly need a talent infusion on defense. That begins with Brown. The Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 professed adoration for Tyrod Taylor as a possible long-term replacement for Philip Rivers was a total smokescreen. As they enter the season with a new starting quarterback for the first time since 2005, there will be competition for the job between Taylor and  Justin Herbert , who threw for more than 10,000 yards and scored more than 100 touchdowns at Oregon. Standing 6-foot-6, 237 pounds, Herbert\u2019s size and arm strength are consistent with a prototypical N.F.L. quarterback, and he led the Ducks to a Pac-12 championship and a victory at the Rose Bowl in January with not much talent at receiver. The question is how this  quiet kid who has spent his entire life in Eugene , Ore. and only recently opened a social media account will react to living in a big city with far more media attention. Herbert enters an excellent situation, with a shrewd coach, Anthony Lynn, and talent across the offense, from receiver Keenan Allen to tight end Hunter Henry. The Dolphins didn\u2019t spend the last season tanking \u2014 er, stripping their roster to stockpile draft capital \u2014 so they could be passive this weekend. They avenged the mistake of passing on free agent Drew Brees in 2006 by being aggressive and taking  Tua Tagovailoa , whose season was derailed when he sustained a posterior wall fracture and dislocated hip in a game in November. Instead of competing in the SEC, he had season-ending surgery. Instead of going No. 1 overall, he was surpassed by Burrow. The focus among scouts wasn\u2019t about whether he was a good fit for an N.F.L. team\u2019s offense, but whether he was durable enough to play well again. Tagovailoa was unable to hold his own pro day because of the coronavirus pandemic, so teams were unable to watch him throw live. Instead, he posted video of himself training on social media. Obviously, the Dolphins are comfortable with his health. Their general manager, Chris Grier, was with the Dolphins (in a different capacity) in 2006, when the team opted for Daunte Culpepper, who wound up playing only one season in Miami. As for Brees, well, he won a Super Bowl in New Orleans and is an all-time great. Now the Dolphins hope that Tagovailoa redeems them. General Manager Dave Gettleman swoons over \u201chog mollies\u201d \u2014 his nomenclature for enormous offensive linemen \u2014 and that, no doubt, is a priority for him  as he builds around quarterback Daniel Jones . In  Andrew Thomas , the Giants have their hog molly. Thomas did nothing but perform at Georgia. He won freshman all-American honors after starting all 15 games at right tackle his first season. He shifted to left tackle his sophomore year and was named to the all-Southeastern Conference team. He started 13 games at left tackle and was named a first-team all-American this season. He takes his inspiration from music , having grown up playing drums. As with music, where he gained confidence through thousands of repetitions, Thomas found comfort in the mundane. The more he practiced, he recognized, the better he would get. On the precipice of his N.F.L. career, Thomas still draws on his musical background. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing in football,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething may happen that\u2019s unexpected, and how well you respond can change the end of the game.\u201d As he established himself at Ohio State as the best cornerback in his draft class,  Jeff Okudah found a role model in Darius Slay.  In each of the last three seasons, Slay, who was traded to Philadelphia last month from Detroit, was selected to the Pro Bowl. Okudah, at 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, will now replace him in Detroit, which had been rumored to be shopping the pick. Jeff Hafley, Okudah\u2019s position coach at Ohio State, coached seven years in the N.F.L., and he said Okudah has exceptional size, speed, acceleration, instincts, inquisitiveness and competitiveness. He started one year for the Buckeyes, who deployed him much like the Jets handled Darrelle Revis in his prime, lining him up alone in man-to-man coverage Okudah projects as a marvelous fit with the Lions for a simple reason: What team wouldn\u2019t want a shutdown cornerback? Coach Ron Rivera was hired to restore pride and discipline (and winning seasons) to a decaying franchise, and for a defensive-minded coach, buttressing the pass rush with the best defensive end prospect in the class is a reasonable way to start. Chase Young, who led the F.B.S. last season with 16\u00bd sacks, joins a reconfigured defensive front \u2014 Rivera switched to a 4-3 from a 3-4 \u2014 that will allow him, as well as other ends Ryan Kerrigan and the 2019 first-round pick Montez Sweat, to concentrate on doing what they do best: harass the quarterback. At Ohio State, Young learned from the renowned defensive line coach Larry Johnson Sr., who also tutored, among others, Nick and Joey Bosa, Aaron Maybin, and Tamba Hali. Johnson challenged himself to find flaws in Young\u2019s technique, analyzing film in slow motion, and together they produced what might be the best over all player in the draft. That\u2019s Young\u2019s opinion, at least. \u201cI definitely think I\u2019m the best player in the draft,\u201d Young said at the league\u2019s scouting combine. \u201cI think I showed it on my tape.\u201d The rebuilding Bengals needed a franchise cornerstone and \u2014 hey, look, it\u2019s  Joe Burrow ! As expected, Cincinnati chose the quarterback Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick, rewarding him for his superlative season at Louisiana State. It\u2019s the first time since 2003, when it took Carson Palmer, that Cincinnati took a quarterback to begin the draft. Burrow, the Heisman Trophy winner, threw for 5,671 yards and set a Football Bowl Subdivision record with 60 touchdown passes \u2014 the final 12 of which came in his last two games, blowouts over Oklahoma and Clemson, to propel L.S.U. to a national title. Only one other player won the Heisman and the national championship, and was chosen first over all, in the same year: Cam Newton, in 2011. \u201cTo jump up to No. 1 overall is just crazy to me but it\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d Burrow said. Quarterbacks drafted early often join teams bereft of, or at least lacking in, offensive talent. In that respect, the Bengals are an anomaly. Burrow enters a reasonably favorable situation, with A.J. Green, Tyler Boyd and John Ross at receiver and Joe Mixon at running back. Preparing for Burrow\u2019s arrival, Cincinnati fortified its defense in free agency, signing cornerbacks Mackensie Alexander and Trae Waynes, defensive lineman D.J. Reader and linebacker Josh Bynes. No matter how well Burrow plays, the Bengals, in all likelihood, won\u2019t be making the playoffs this season. But the team probably won\u2019t be 2-14 like it was in 2019, and for the first time in a long time, they\u2019ll be exciting, and interesting, again. In keeping with the times, all team officials will work remotely from their homes and Commissioner Roger Goodell will announce their 32 picks from the basement of his house in Bronxville, N.Y. He showed fans a tour of his setup in a video posted to Twitter. During the draft, fans will see 58 top prospects via remote video from their homes, after the league sent \u201ctechnology kits\u201d to them by mail. (They will have to hug Goodell at some other point.) Between picks, viewers will see telethon-style performances from celebrities, including the comedian Kevin Hart and the singer Harry Connick, Jr. Team officials will have 10 minutes to make their first-round picks on Thursday, and less time for Rounds 2-7 on Friday and Saturday. General managers and coaches have been showing off their draft tech setups on social media, with the Giants  Dave Gettleman showing off  a relatively lo-fi home office, at least compared with that of  Jaguars Coach Doug Marrone . If there are technical glitches while a team is on the clock, the N.F.L. will have the option of extending the amount of time the team has to make a pick. No one in the N.F.L. knows how the draft will unfold. But the first two picks, which belong to the Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Redskins, feel as certain as sunrise. Who cares if  Joe Burrow  has 9-inch hands, as they were  reportedly measured  at the draft scouting combine in February? The Bengals certainly won\u2019t. Burrow, the Louisiana State quarterback, won the Heisman Trophy last season. He also carried the Tigers to a national championship. A son of Ohio \u2014 he grew up in Athens, about 150 miles east of Cincinnati \u2014 Burrow returns to his home state to resurrect a franchise that hasn\u2019t won a playoff game since January 1991, almost six years before he was born. For the second consecutive year, a defensive end from Ohio State is primed to be taken at No. 2. It\u2019s hard to fathom, given how well Nick Bosa played as a rookie for the 49ers, but  Chase Young , who is likely bound for Washington, might wind up being better. Young had 16\u00bd sacks last season, a single-season record for the Buckeyes. Across his two seasons at Ohio State, he had 27 total sacks and 35\u00bd tackles for loss. As Washington rebuilds under a  new coaching staff led by Ron Rivera , it can\u2019t afford to waste its draft picks. It won\u2019t with Young. This draft is loaded with intrigue, but where Alabama quarterback  Tua Tagovailoa  gets picked Thursday night \u2014 and by whom \u2014 is the most fascinating story line. Once the presumptive No. 1 over all pick, Tagovailoa sustained a season-ending hip injury in November that shrouded his future. His talent is unquestioned. But teams must consider both his present health and his history of injuries \u2014 a task complicated by the travel restrictions wrought by the pandemic, which prevents teams from evaluating him themselves. Oregon\u2019s Justin Herbert  is expected to tempt the Miami Dolphins and Los Angeles Chargers, who pick fifth and sixth and each need a passer. Herbert stands 6-foot-6, 237 pounds and is only the second Ducks quarterback to throw for over 10,000 yards and score more than 100 touchdowns (Marcus Mariota is the other), stats he put up without elite receivers. One of the biggest variables in every draft is the trade deals that teams make to pick earlier or stockpile selections for later. In the past 20 years, the draft has featured an average of 13 trades in the first round. With facilities closed to most personnel and all travel banned, coaches and scouts have had fewer in-person interviews with prospects than in other years. The lack of information about players from smaller schools may make known quantities \u2014 free agents as well as college players who appeared in a lot of televised games \u2014 more valuable, leading teams to make  more trades than in a typical year . No team\u2019s moves are more anticipated  than those of the New England Patriots , which ended the 2019 season with an uncharacteristic playoff loss in the wild-card round, then subsequently let the franchise cornerstone quarterback  Tom Brady walk in free agency  and  traded Rob Gronkowski  to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With Jarrett Stidham, who has four career pass attempts (with one interception), and Brian Hoyer, a 34-year-old journeyman who has lost 12 of his last 13 starts, on the roster, New England seems poised to draft a quarterback at some point. Bill Belichick has 12 picks, but only one, the 23rd overall, in the first round. Two points of history worth noting: Belichick is notorious for trading down, preferring to dig for gems in later rounds, and he has not often drafted impactful wide receivers, a position of depth in this year\u2019s class.",

    "title": "Coronavirus: The worry of working in supermarkets and pharmacies - BBC News",
    "text": "\"It's been non-stop for the past few weeks. No matter how hard we try, the shelves aren't full.\" There are many people around the country who have been following the government's  advice around social distancing  - that's avoiding going out for non-essential reasons due to the coronavirus pandemic. For quite a few of us, that means having to work from home.  But that's not an option everyone can take. Supermarket worker Tiff has no choice but to go to work, despite the infection risks. \"In an ideal world, supermarkets would close too, but I know that's not possible right now,\" the 26-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. You've probably seen people flooding to supermarkets, trying to get as many items as they can -  panic buying things like handwash and antibacterial gel. Tiff's in charge of the health and beauty section in her supermarket, which includes those items. And she says the rush of panic buying because of coronavirus has been \"horrible and overwhelming\". \"People have been yelling at me, asking why it's not there when we run out.\" With cases of Covid-19 rising around the country, you might imagine that lots of frontline workers wouldn't want to work anymore. But not Mehfuz Dasu Patel. The 28-year-old helps run a group of community pharmacies in north west England, which serve 250 care homes and deliver medicines to around 20,000 patients. And those patients are the reason he's still going to work. If Mehfuz decides to stop working, \"vulnerable people will go without medicines\", he says. \"It's not the sort of business that can just disappear or you can work from home. We have to keep delivering to them, despite what's happening in the world.\" And despite her experiences in the supermarket, Tiff agrees with Mehfuz that it's important for those on the frontline to keep working at a time of crisis. \"People need supplies - they're looking for hygiene products and food - so we have to do what we can. If we don't, it'll just be more anger and panic,\" she says. Tiff admits feeling \"anxious and afraid\" because of the uncertainty around the virus and possible impact on her health. She suffered with a bad cough a few years ago, which she worries has damaged her lungs. People with  underlying health problems  are at greater risk of developing severe symptoms. \"I'm always thinking about it and a bit worried,\" she says. And Tiff's not the only one to have those concerns. Jade Barnett, 19, has two jobs - in a warehouse and a supermarket - and she's worried she could catch the coronavirus at work and take it home to her family. \"It's not as much about me. I just don't want to catch anything and then pass it onto my nan or nephew,\" she says. She wears gloves at work and is \"quite cautious\". But with lots of people whose jobs are at risk, Jade says she's grateful she's still able to work, despite the potential health risk. \"There are lots of people out there who have lost their jobs, or aren't able to earn any money. How are people meant to survive without money and a job?\" Like Tiff and Mehfuz, she acknowledges that she has a vital \"role to play\" in helping the country fight coronavirus.  Jade feels it's something that now comes with \"extra pressure\". When she's packing deliveries in the warehouse, she's aware that not having all the items someone needs can make things difficult for customers. \"It means they won't get a good shop and it might be someone who can't physically come to the shops,\" she says. \"So you do think about things like that and feel more responsibility.\" When working in the supermarket, she says it can be hard when dealing with elderly people because of limits on buying certain items. \"They often get lots of things and you have to tell them they can't take that much. You feel bad because you never know how much someone needs.\" Mehfuz says the current crisis is \"the toughest time\" he's ever experienced. \"Everyone at work understands the pressure is on us to deliver for the vulnerable,\" he says, adding that customers have called up worried his service may be shut down. \"They tell us that the country needs you to continue working. That motivates me and the others a lot.\" It's an exhausting time for both Jade and Tiff, and they can't wait for the crisis to be over. \"It can be a lot of night shifts, sometimes 16-hour shifts. It feels like 24/7,\" Jade says. \"Hopefully all of this calms down soon. Because you do have some really rough days and it's not nice.\"  \"We'll keep working, but even if it's just for a few weeks, we need a break,\" Tiff adds.

    "title": "DeVos Excludes \u2018Dreamers\u2019 From Coronavirus College Relief - The New York Times",
    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Education Department will prohibit colleges from granting emergency assistance to undocumented students, even those known as Dreamers who are under federal protection, according to  guidance  issued to colleges and universities on Tuesday. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ordered higher education institutions to dole out more than $6 billion in emergency relief only to students who are eligible for federal financial aid, including U.S. citizens or legal residents. The directive effectively excluded tens of thousands of students who are living in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, an Obama-era policy that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. President Trump has moved to end the program, but that effort is awaiting Supreme Court review. The measure will compound the challenges facing undocumented students, whose families have also been excluded from aid like stimulus checks for individuals and unemployment insurance, said Miriam Feldblum, the executive director of the Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, which advocates on behalf of immigrant students. In a  recent repor t, the organization counted 450,000 undocumented students enrolled in the nation\u2019s higher education system, with 87 percent of DACA-eligible students in undergraduate programs, and 13 percent in graduate-level programs. In a  recent survey  of more than 1,600 students, conducted by the organization TheDream.US, a national scholarship organization for Dreamers, 80 percent of those working have experienced income loss, said Candy Marshall, the group\u2019s president. Sixty-five percent reported that they needed help with rent and utilities, and 48 percent said that of food. \u201cThis is not simply saying undocumented students shouldn\u2019t get things that other students don\u2019t get,\u201d Ms. Feldblum said. \u201cThis was a choice. This was going to be a core lifeline.\u201d The funding is part of $12.6 billion allocated directly to colleges and universities under Congress\u2019s $2 trillion coronavirus stabilization law to help them recoup financial damages caused by the pandemic. Half of those funds are supposed to go directly to students affected by campus closures. In the coming weeks, schools are expected to award emergency relief grants to students to pay for expenses like food, housing, child care and technology. The stimulus law, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, directs the secretary to distribute the stimulus funding to colleges in the same manner the department distributes other financial aid. \u200bBut it \u200bdid not explicitly define which students are eligible. Undocumented students do not qualify for federal financial aid funds, but \u200bthe emergency grants do not fall under that category. In a statement, Angela L. Morabito, a department spokeswoman, defended its decision. \u201cThe CARES Act makes clear that this taxpayer-funded relief fund should be targeted to U.S. citizens, which is consistently echoed throughout the law,\u201d she said. Higher education groups were not surprised that the Trump administration targeted unauthorized immigrants, but said Ms. DeVos\u2019s messaging had been inconsistent. In a  letter  announcing the grants, Ms. DeVos said the law \u201cprovides institutions with significant discretion on how to award this emergency assistance to students,\u201d and \u201cthe only statutory requirement is that the funds be used to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus.\u201d \u201cThis means that each institution may develop its own system and process for determining how to allocate these funds, which may include distributing the funds to all students or only to students who demonstrate significant need,\u201d she wrote. The new guidance has caused \u201chead-snapping uncertainty on college campuses,\u201d said Terry Hartle, a senior vice president at the American Council on Education. \u201cWe fear that campuses will be in the position to only give money to people already getting financial aid, using a complicated, time-consuming process that is completely inconsistent with emergency grants,\u201d Mr. Hartle said. He added that the decision was clearly made by the department. \u201cCongress had nothing to do with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe department has to own it.\u201d Justin Draeger, the president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said the department\u2019s method to exclude DACA and undocumented students by enforcing federal aid eligibility rules created obstacles for  large swaths  of other students, including international students and citizens who do not fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. The department\u2019s interpretation would require that schools verify eligibility requirements like whether students have minor drug convictions, have defaulted on student loans or, for men, have not registered with the Selective Service. Mr. Draeger said he feared schools would default to prioritizing students who had federal financial aid applications on file rather than those who needed the assistance most. \u201cSchools are feeling frustrated that the department has overreached, and they\u2019re cautious about moving forward at this point,\u201d Mr. Draeger said. Wesley Whistle,  a senior adviser for policy and strategy  at the think tank New America, said the measure was consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s track record, especially since relief was being directed to for-profit colleges, which the administration has treated favorably. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that they\u2019re willing to give away money to for-profits, including those that have had settlements for predatory practices, but they want to make it harder for black and brown students to get it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a pandemic, for Pete\u2019s sake.\u201d",

    "title": "German court tries Syrian regime officials in landmark case - The Washington Post",
    "text": "BERLIN \u2014 The German town of Koblenz, which straddles a confluence of the Rhine and Moselle rivers, lies some 2,000 miles from Syria. But on Thursday, its regional court began to hear a landmark case against two alleged former Syrian regime officials. German prosecutors used the principle of \u201cuniversal jurisdiction\u201d \u2014 which allows the prosecution of serious international crimes committed in another country \u2014 to bring charges against the two Syrian nationals who had claimed asylum in Germany. Anwar Raslan, 57, alleged to have been head of investigations at a branch of Syria\u2019s General Intelligence Directorate, has been charged with crimes against humanity, 58 murders, rape and sexual assault. Another defendant, Eyad al-Gharib, 43, is charged with aiding a crime against humanity. Indictments were read Thursday, but neither defendant made statements or entered pleas. But for those who have been fighting to hold the Syrian regime to account, the significance of this case extends far beyond the crimes of two individuals. It marks the first time an independent court will issue findings on President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s tools of suppression during the mass demonstrations of 2011 and the civil war that followed. After nine years of conflict, monitoring groups estimate that the death toll is more than 380,000 people, not including 88,000 they say have died in regime jails. Thousands more remain missing. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment,\u201d said Anwar al-Bunni, a prominent Syrian human rights lawyer who is due to testify. \u201cIt\u2019s a real court, and no one can question its independence. Its decision will be seen by the whole world.\u201d It was a chance encounter in 2014 that set the trial in motion. Bunni, who had claimed asylum in Berlin, says he recognized a man at his refugee center but at first could not place him. It was only after a friend told him a former regime official had arrived that he made the connection. Raslan, he says, is the man who arrested him outside his home in the Damascus neighborhood of Kafr Souseh in 2006, leading to the five years he spent in prison. They saw each other around the center several times, says Bunni, who now runs the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research from Berlin. \u201cHe recognized me for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anger. My enemy is not a person. My enemy is the regime, the whole structure.\u201d Bunni says at the time he was not aware of the possibility to pursue people such as Raslan in Germany. The principle of international jurisdiction is one of the few avenues available for prosecuting serious international crimes committed in Syria, and rights groups and advocates say it is increasingly important in ensuring perpetrators cannot escape justice. Syria is not a party to the treaty that established the International Criminal Court at The Hague, and China and Russia have vetoed setting up a special tribunal for the Syrian regime. Raslan is accused of crimes that took place between April\u200929, 2011, and Sept.\u20097, 2012, when Syria was gripped by revolution. Prosecutors say his crimes happened \u201cin the context of an extensive and systematic attack on the civilian population.\u201d They argue that the unit Raslan headed at Branch 251 tortured at least 4,000 detainees during that period, using methods including beatings and electric shocks. At least 58 people also died under his command during that time, they say, adding that inmates were denied food and medical care. Prosecutors argue that Raslan, as head of the investigative unit, knew of the extent of torture at the facility. \u2018I still have nightmares\u2019: Voices from inside Assad\u2019s torture network in Syria Gharib is accused of being a subordinate who also was aware of the systematic torture in Branch 251. Prosecutors say that in 2011, he searched the streets of Damascus for people fleeing a demonstration that had been violently dispersed. Eventually, 30 people were arrested, they say, with the defendant accompanying them on a bus to where they would be detained. \u201cThe detainees had already been beaten on the way to the prison and upon arrival in prison,\u201d the prosecution said in a release. \u201cIn prison, they were brutally abused and tortured systematically.\u201d In court Thursday, Gharib\u2019s attorneys argued against the use of evidence he gave under questioning to German authorities, as he was informed he was a witness at the time rather than a suspect. Assad was asked about the case during an interview with the RT news broadcaster in November. \u201cWe don\u2019t have torture units,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a torture policy in Syria.\u201d He said the Syrian government has \u201call the information,\u201d so it has no need to extract it through torture, but that \u201cindividual incidents\u201d may happen. The trial, expected to stretch for months, will be the first time Syrian victims have faced an alleged perpetrator in court. \u201cThat\u2019s a really significant milestone for the rule of law in the conflict in Syria,\u201d said Steve Kostas, a senior legal officer with the Open Society Justice Initiative, which is representing six former prisoners of the branch. The trial also will be a test for evidence gathered by justice groups. The nonprofit Commission for International Justice and Accountability has collected more than 800,000 Syrian government documents it hopes can be used in these prosecutions and others. \u201cTo show that the evidence that they have been collecting in Syria can be used in a court of law and lead to a conviction would be an extremely significant accomplishment,\u201d Kostas said. He said several of the individuals who were detained in Branch 251 at the relevant time appear within a trove of more than 50,000 photographs smuggled out of Syria by a military defector code-named \u201cCeasar.\u201d That evidence was passed on to German law enforcement, Kostas said. Raslan announced his defection in 2012, which has made his prosecution a subject of debate in some circles. \u201cThere were many arguments among the Syrians,\u201d Bunni said. \u201cBut justice is justice,\u201d he said. \u201cCrimes against humanity and war crimes are not small crimes. It can\u2019t mean he has immunity.\u201d While accountability for more-senior regime figures remains out of reach, Bunni expects there will be more trials such as the one in Koblenz. He and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights have submitted complaints to German prosecutors against six other people they accuse of being high-level Syrian intelligence officials. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time,\u201d Bunni said of the case. \u201cIt will not be the last time.\u201d Sarah Dadouch in Beirut contributed to this report.

    "title": "Coronavirus hits Mexico?s economy: Oil, tourism, trade, remittances - The Washington Post",
    "text": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The Mexican economy was already in recession, having contracted in 2019 for the first time in a decade and projecting more losses in 2020. The peso was among the worst-performing currencies in the world. Then came the  coronavirus . The pandemic is wreaking financial havoc everywhere. But in Mexico, it\u2019s taking specific aim at the pillars of the Mexican economy: trade, oil, remittances and tourism. Economists here are now predicting an economic collapse worse than the so-called \u201ctequila crisis\u201d of the 1990s, when inflation soared, poverty deepened and migration surged. One economic think tank warns of a downturn that  could force 22 million Mexicans into poverty this year . The International Monetary Fund expects GDP to contract by 6.6 percent, second in Latin America only to collapsing Venezuela. Bank of America predicts an 8 percent contraction. U.S. is deporting infected migrants back to vulnerable countries \u201cMexico is like someone who was about to fall down the stairs, and then coronavirus came and pushed him,\u201d said Valeria Moy, an economist at the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Aut\u00f3nomo de M\u00e9xico. \u201cHe was going to fall anyway. But now he\u2019s going to fall farther and faster.\u201d Downturns in the 1980s and \u201990s coincided with greater violence in Mexico, and pushed more migration to the United States. Still, Mexico\u2019s government has done less than others in Latin America to stabilize the economy amid the unfolding crisis. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who is deeply concerned about increasing the national debt, has focused a modest recovery package on the country\u2019s poorest citizens, while offering little to small and medium-sized businesses.\u00a0 Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access. The limited scope of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s stimulus plan \u2014 it includes expediting an existing small-business loan program worth about $10 billion \u2014 has raised concern among members of Mexico\u2019s central bank. Coronavirus outbreaks at Mexico\u2019s hospitals raise alarm, protests \u00a0\u201cTo provide liquidity to firms, that\u2019s a place the government could step in. But it seems this government isn\u2019t willing to accept a fiscal deficit,\u201d said Jonathan Heath, the deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico. \u201cThe president is talking about helping the poor and doesn\u2019t leave much room to help out small and medium firms. It\u2019s not very orthodox.\u201d Of all the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the IMF reports,  only the Bahamas is spending less  as a percentage of its GDP to support households and businesses during the crisis.\u00a0 More than half of Mexico\u2019s workforce hold informal jobs \u2014 they\u2019re  housekeepers , vendors, day laborers and small-business owners who do not receive social security, are not entitled to sick leave and do not receive pensions. When they\u2019re laid off, as many have been already, there\u2019s no support system to save them from destitution. The size of the informal economy means there\u2019s no useful estimate of the unemployment rate.\u00a0 Informal businesses are suffering. In the center of Monterrey, Mexico\u2019s third-largest city, the Sastrer\u00eda Garibaldi has for 30 years made mariachi outfits. Owners Otilio Cruz and his son, Eduardo, estimate they can survive another month without income before shutting down. They have received no assistance from the government. \u201cWhat does it matter if we survive covid-19 if afterward we die of hunger?\u201d Otilio Cruz asked. Mexican factories boost production of medical supplies for U.S. hospitals while country struggles with its own coronavirus outbreak L\u00f3pez Obrador took office in 2018 promising to end institutionalized corruption and improve the lives of Mexico\u2019s poorest people. He has indeed tried to do both. But in the process, the longtime leftist has made decisions that sent shock waves through the private sector, depressing both domestic and foreign investment. In the most well-known example, L\u00f3pez Obrador scrapped plans for a new airport after construction had begun. More problems followed: a dismantling of the country\u2019s energy reform, an insistence on building a refinery against the advice of engineers and economists, the halting last month of a $1 billion brewery project. \u201cThere\u2019s just no trust between AMLO and the business community,\u201d said Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the impact of that on investment.\u201d Mexico is now the United States\u2019 largest trading partner. But economists say businesses have been reluctant to spend more money until L\u00f3pez Obrador offers more certainty. If Mexico is slow to recover from its outbreak, many here worry that more trade could be lost to China. \u201cChina is starting to open its economy and the U.S. is a bit ahead of Mexico on the pandemic curve, so when they start looking for suppliers in Mexico, it could still be closed, and they\u2019ll look to China,\u201d Moy said. \u201cThose production chains that took years to build are at risk of being destroyed.\u201d Coronavirus on the border: Why Mexico has so few cases compared with the U.S. In northern Mexico, workers in factories run by major American companies have staged protests, refusing to work during the pandemic. Lear Corp., Regal Beloit and Honeywell International Inc. have all reported covid-19 deaths. This week, for the first time in history, Mexico\u2019s oil export price dipped into negative territory \u2014 yet another blow to one of the country\u2019s most important industries. Last week, Moody\u2019s downgraded the debt of the national oil company, Pemex, to junk status. Pemex is weighed down by more than $100 billion in debt. It will now shut newly finished oil wells that the government once saw as an engine for growth. Tourism generates 17 percent of Mexico\u2019s GDP \u2014 a larger percentage than any emerging country other than Thailand. It was one pillar of the economy that was largely unaffected by economic uncertainty. But as countries around the world have declared lockdowns, and flights and hotel reservations have been canceled, the industry has been hit harder than almost any other during the pandemic. Globally, the World Travel and Tourism Council warns that 75 million jobs could be lost. In Mexico\u2019s tourist resort of Canc\u00fan, hotel room occupancy fell last week to 2.8 percent. Coronavirus collides with Latin America\u2019s maid culture \u2014 with sometimes deadly results Mexico\u2019s Tourism Ministry has begun to plan a new marketing campaign aimed at the United States, Europe and parts of Asia, to be rolled out as the virus ebbs. Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco Marqu\u00e9s has outlined what the campaign will look like. One tagline: \u201cMexico needs you.\u201d Remittances \u2014 money sent back to Mexicans by relatives abroad \u2014 account for roughly 3 percent of Mexico\u2019s GDP. But they\u2019re an enormous boon to some of the country\u2019s poorest communities, where wages have risen little in recent decades. In the state of Michoac\u00e1n, for example, remittances contribute more than 11 percent to the economy. Nationwide, 1.65 million households in the country receive such transfers, mostly from migrants in the United States. BBVA now says remittances could crash 20 percent from 2020 to 2021. It\u2019s unclear whether a shrinking economy would drive more migration to the United States. In 1995, the year after government devaluation of the peso against the dollar triggered the tequila crisis, migration surged. That also happened in 1982, after a previous peso devaluation. \u00a0But a slow U.S. recovery from its own coronavirus shock could temper any exodus. \u201cIn the mid-1990s, when Mexico\u2019s economy collapsed, the U.S. economy was sizzling, so Mexicans came north in large numbers,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cBut during the global recession in 2007 and 2008, Mexicans actually stayed home even though things were terrible, because there were no available jobs in the U.S. \u201cI think this crisis is likely to be like 2007-2008. Many Mexicans may want to go north because of how bad things get at home, but they won\u2019t because their friends and relatives in the U.S. will be telling them that there aren\u2019t any jobs.\u201d As coronavirus layoffs surge in richer countries, poorer ones lose vital remittance payments If the U.S. economy strengthens while the Mexican economy remains in recession, Selee and others say, migration flows from Mexico are likely to increase once again. The economic crisis of the 1990s also coincided with a marked increase in crime. Already, drug cartels appear to be capitalizing on both the economic downturn and the government\u2019s limited response to it. They\u2019re handing out small aid packages to people in territory under their control. The daughter of former Sinaloa cartel chief Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n is distributing boxes of provisions with his face stenciled on top. With Mexico\u2019s homicide rate already at all-time high, growing cartel influence is a frightening prospect. In the 1990s, then-President Bill Clinton, worried about a flood of crime and migration in the wake of the tequila crisis,  extended a $20 billion bailout to Mexico . President Trump, in contrast, campaigned on promises to bold a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and to make Mexico pay for it. He has pressured L\u00f3pez Obrador to crack down on migration from Mexico with tariff threats and border closures. Analysts say Trump might be more reluctant than Clinton was to extend a lifeline. \u201cIf we see renewed Mexican migration at the border, and Mexico is seen as having failed to respond to the pandemic,\u201d Wood said, \u201cwe could see things moving in the opposite direction.\u201d Now joining the fight against coronavirus: The world\u2019s armed rebels, drug cartels and gangs Public health experts: Coronavirus could overwhelm the developing world Soldiers around the world get a new mission: Enforcing coronavirus lockdowns Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

The House on Thursday passed a $484 billion aid package to replenish a small-business loan program that was overwhelmed with demand. Trump has said he will sign the bill, which also includes funding for hospitals and a new coronavirus testing program. Meanwhile, the official death toll from the  coronavirus outbreak in the United States  is closing in on 50,000, with the number of total reported cases approaching 862,000. Meanwhile, more than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since the outbreak began to paralyze the economy \u2014  a figure that grew by 4.4 million  last week, according to jobless figures released Thursday.

Cuomo,  recently revealed  she bathed in Clorox bleach while recovering from the coronavirus, along with using multiple other holistic methods. Bleach is poisonous if inhaled or swallowed and is a skin irritant.  Clorox\u2019s website states  bleach is not recommended for personal hygiene of any kind and consumers should always avoid direct skin and eye contact with both undiluted bleach, as well as prolonged contact with the various bleach solutions for household cleaning and laundry. Cristina is the founder and CEO of a wellness publication called  The Purist , where she has blogged about her family health wellness regimens following her own diagnosis. Her husband, Chris, revealed he had a positive coronavirus diagnosis on March 31 and later shared that Cristina had as well. Their 14-year-old son, Mario, also has contracted the coronavirus. According to Cristina\u2019s post, she details enlisting a doctor to administer at-home antiviral infusions at her home. The doctor showed up in a hazmat outfit and 3M mask, before administering the multiple infusions. While stating IVs are costly, she promotes and notes there is a cheaper option for \u201cneutralizing heavy metals\u201d: bathing in bleach. \u201cI added \u00bd cup ONLY of Clorox to a full bath of warm water to combat the radiation and metals in my system and oxygenate it,\u201d Cristina wrote. \u201cWe want to neutralize heavy metals because they slow-up the electromagnetic frequency of our cells, which is our energy field, and we need a good flow of energy \u2026 There is no danger in doing this.\u201d She also mentions that household bleach is not a chlorine. The World Health Organization  warned  that spraying people with chlorine and other powerful disinfectants can harm their eyes and mouths and \u201cwill not kill viruses that have already entered\u201d the body. Bleach and alcohol can be an effective disinfectant on hard surfaces. With a white scarf wrapped around her face, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) swooped into the well of the House and took out a green card, signed her name and voted yes. She then headed toward the back of the chamber, serving as a stern enforcer giving orders. When Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) lingered after casting her vote, Pelosi waved her hands, gloved in medical blue, at her close friend, ordering her to leave quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t stand there,\u201d she yelled at DeLauro. So began one of the strangest set of votes in congressional history. Read more  here . President Trump and Vice President Pence showcased emerging laboratory evidence that found the coronavirus is not as durable when exposed to ultraviolet light and hot and humid conditions. The experiments, carried out by the Homeland Security Department\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate at the Army\u2019s high biosecurity lab at Ft. Detrick, Md., largely match other laboratory studies conducted elsewhere showing that the novel coronavirus, like many other viruses, does not survive as long on certain surfaces when exposed to high ultraviolet light and warm and humid conditions. The laboratory results show that increases in temperature, humidity and sunlight can all speed up how fast the virus is destroyed, based on measurements of its half-life when exposed to these elements. The half-life is a measurement of the time it takes for a given amount of the virus to become reduced by half. \u201cSo you start with a thousand particles of the virus. In 18 hours, you\u2019re down to 518, hours after that, you\u2019re down to 250 and so on and so forth,\u201d said William N. Bryan, acting undersecretary for science and technology at DHS. A slide shared by Bryan revealed that the half-life of the virus, in the absence of sunlight, lowers from 18 hours to one hour when the temperature rises from the low 70s to the mid-90s and the humidity rises from 20 to 80 percent. Adding in sunlight, the virus\u2019s half-life decreases from 18 hours at temperatures of 70 to 75 degrees and humidity of 20 percent to just around 1.5 minutes. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed, and Bryan cautioned that officials cannot rely on summer conditions alone to beat the virus. Warm states, such as Georgia and Florida, are seeing significant outbreaks, as are warm and humid countries, such as Singapore, suggesting the weather may not be a dominant factor in spreading the virus. Trump said the results may indicate the virus will ebb in the summer, as he had previously suggested but was criticized for due to a lack of scientific evidence. \u201cI hope people enjoy the sun and if it has an impact, that\u2019s great,\u201d he said. Read more  here.  For several days, President Trump has refused to answer questions about a study that showed poor outcomes for a drug combination that he previously hailed as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for treating covid-19. Reporters have tried to ask the president about hydroxychloroquine in the daily White House briefings this week, but each time it comes up, Trump moves quickly to the next question \u2014 a stark departure from previous briefings, when he would promote the drug unprompted. On April 13, for example, Trump boasted that his administration had \u201cdeployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine. .\u2009.\u2009. We have millions of doses that we bought, and many people are using it all over the country.\u201d  On Tuesday, a preliminary study, which has not been peer reviewed, was posted that indicated  hydroxychloroquine had no benefit in patients and was associated with higher rates of death . At Tuesday's White House briefing, a reporter asked Trump if he had seen the study. \u201cI don\u2019t know of the report,\u201d Trump said. \u201cObviously, there have been some very good reports, and perhaps this one\u2019s not a good report, but we\u2019ll be looking at it. We\u2019ll have a comment on it at some point.\u201d  On Thursday, The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Rucker asked Trump why he had stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine. \u201cI haven\u2019t at all,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of very good results, and we had some results that perhaps aren\u2019t so good.\u201d  Rucker asked whether he had seen the Veterans Affairs study. \u201cI have not,\u201d Trump said. The  NFL draft  began Thursday night with Commissioner Roger Goodell, the general managers and coaches from the 32 teams and dozens of draft-eligible players participating remotely. Goodell, speaking from his home in New York state, opened the remote version of the NFL draft. \u201cThis is different for us and it\u2019s different for you,\u201d Goodell said, \u201cbecause it has to be.\u201d This is what the  #NFLDraft  looks like in 2020.  Wow \ud83d\ude33  pic.twitter.com/tzZHABjImp Goodell wore a sports coat and no tie. He stood in front of two screens with NFL Draft 2020 logos. \u201cWe will get through this together,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cAnd when we do, we will be here for you.\u201d Goodell asked viewers to participate in a moment of silence for victims of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Harry Connick Jr. then performed the national anthem from his home. Actor Ashton Kutcher helped set up Iowa\u2019s $26 million contract with Utah companies to increase coronavirus testing, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) said Thursday at her  daily news briefing . \u201cHe asked if I was familiar with what was happening with \u2018 Test Utah ,\u2019 and how it looks very promising, and it looked like other states should potentially take a look at that,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cHe knew one of the individuals that had been working on that was a friend of his, or just a colleague and knew him, and so he said, \u2018If you\u2019d like, I\u2019d be happy to connect the two of you.\u2019 \u201d On Tuesday, Reynolds announced that the state had launched the  \u201cTest Iowa Initiative\u201d  to expand testing capacity to limit the spread of the virus in Iowa. The state is partnering with Nomi Health and DOMO, which are part of a partnership that already launched a similar initiative in Utah. Last week, Iowa signed a $26 million contract with the Utah firms to set up drive-through sites to test Iowans for the virus. Reynolds said Kutcher, an Iowa native, told her about the testing efforts in Utah during a recent phone call when she was asking him if he would record a  public service announcement  for the state. After speaking with the connection from Kutcher and checking in with the Utah government officials, Reynolds said she and her team were impressed with the companies and the testing and decided to move forward. During Thursday\u2019s White House briefing, Vice President Pence referred to Reynolds and Iowa\u2019s initiative. He said the White House coronavirus task force would convene on a conference Friday where governors such as Reynolds would be discussing the practices and methods they are employing to increase testing, he said. As of Thursday, there had been a total of 96 coronavirus-related deaths in Iowa and 3,924 confirmed infections, according to the state health department. Governors preparing to roll back restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus are in some cases acting without the input and against the wishes of their own medical and emergency management staff. Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, announced he would let tattoo parlors, hair salons and bowling alleys reopen without receiving guidance from the panel of doctors tapped to advise him and without giving advance notice to regional health departments responsible for carrying out his orders, according to physicians and state officials. In Utah, the governor lifted a statewide lockdown on elective procedures before his medical supply team had finished estimating how quickly hospitals would exhaust their supply of personal protective equipment, according to members of the state\u2019s response team. In these states, among those moving fastest to jump-start idle economies, plans are proceeding without the full approval of medical professionals and emergency response officials closest to the ground-level unfolding of the outbreak.

A union representing 50,000 flight attendants asked the federal government Thursday to use its authority to mandate masks for everyone boarding planes and end all leisure travel until the novel coronavirus pandemic wanes. In  a letter to the departments of Transportation and Health and Human Services , the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said, \u201cWhile this global system is integral to our modern economy, its essential inter-connectedness also provides a convenient pathway for opportunistic pathogens to hitch rides on unsuspecting crew members and travelers and spread all over the world. \u201cAs some of the most frequent travelers, flight attendants feel a deep responsibility to ensure that our workplace risks of acquiring and spreading communicable diseases are minimized as much as possible.\u201d The letter came the same day United Airlines announced, effective Friday, all flight attendants will wear a mask. The union is also asking the government to mandate that airlines provide hand-washing stations, sanitizer and disposable gloves. The union said at least 250 members have tested positive for the coronavirus. Air travel is down about 95 percent compared to this time last year, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Vice President Pence has repeatedly expressed confidence the United States will have much of the coronavirus pandemic \u201cbehind us\u201d by early summer. In multiple  interviews  over the past two days, including Thursday\u2019s White House news briefing, Pence reiterated \u2013 while looking at current trends \u2013 that by Memorial Day weekend or into early June, he believes the country will \u201clargely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us.\u201d In an interview with conservative radio host  Rush Limbaugh  on Thursday, Pence sounded optimistic: \u201cif current trend lines hold, that by early June, we could largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us, and begin to see our nation open back up and go back to work.\u201d Pence also stated that there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d that if people have had coronavirus in the past, they will be able to \u201cenjoy some immunity from it in the future.\u201d At the Thursday briefing, Pence once again pushed the timeline when discussing the potential \u201csummer respite\u201d from the virus. He also acknowledged the potential return of the coronavirus in the fall. Pence also backed up his early summer timeline by pointing to emerging evidence showing warm, humid weather could aid the containment of covid-19 in the summer. William N. Bryan, acting undersecretary for science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, discussed the emerging laboratory evidence at Thursday\u2019s briefing. \u201c[Bryan] will outline, as the president said, encouraging news about the impact that heat and sunlight have on the coronavirus, which will increase the confidence that we feel about the coming summer,\u201d Pence said. After an administration official presented findings from a lab study that showed direct sunlight helps to kill the coronavirus, Trump had ideas. \u201cSupposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way,\u201d Trump said to Bill Bryan, the undersecretary for science and technology at the Homeland Security Department during the evening White House briefing. He urged him to test it. The president then mused that perhaps bleach or another disinfectant can also be injected into the body to kill the virus. \u201cIs there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets on the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs,\u201d the president said. He encouraged Bryan to test that theory too, but noted the government should involve medical doctors on that one. Trump also reminded everyone that he had once suggested that heat would kill the virus. \u201cI just threw it out as a suggestion, but it seems like that\u2019s the case, because when it\u2019s on a surface, that would last for a long time. When that surface is outside, it goes very quickly. It dies very quickly with the sun,\u201d Trump said. Later, the president again mentioned that Bryan should test whether light and heat could be used to cure the coronavirus. \u201cIf you could and maybe you can, maybe you can\u2019t. Again, I say maybe you can. Maybe you can\u2019t. I\u2019m not a doctor. I\u2019m like a person that has a good you know what,\u201d Trump said, pointing to his head. The House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan $484 billion spending package to support small businesses and health-care providers. Some money will also go to coronavirus testing. Just five lawmakers voted \u201cno\u201d \u2014 one Democrat, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), who didn\u2019t think the aid did enough, and four Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Ken Buck (Colo.) and Jody Hice (Ga.), who didn\u2019t support the increased federal government spending. The \u201cyeas\u201d were 388. The legislation was a negotiation between the Trump administration and congressional leaders after the small business  Paycheck Protection Program  \u2014 created as part of Congress\u2019s $2 trillion economic stimulus package \u2014 ran out of money last week and stopped processing loans. The new measure includes $310 billion to replenish this program, $60 billion for a  separate small-business emergency loan and grant program , $75 billion for hospitals and health-care providers, and $25 billion for a new coronavirus testing program. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Anthony G. Brown (D-Md.) introduced legislation Thursday to create a federal price-control program on novel coronavirus equipment to lower prices and direct supplies to where they are needed most. The Pandemic Response and Interstate Cost Equity Act, or PRICE Act, would address bidding wars for equipment, which have led to complaints about price-gouging, shortages and federal authorities seizing shipments of supplies designated for states and municipalities. Warren said in a written statement that the White House is \u201cdragging [its] feet and burying [its] heads instead of using their power to make sure states have the critical resources they need. When states go out on their own, the federal government is outbidding them or outright seizing supplies.\u201d  \u201cThis virus isn\u2019t siloed away to one state or region; this is a nationwide problem,\u201d Brown said in a written statement. \u201cStates should not have to compete against each other to save the lives of their residents.\u201d  The legislation calls for, among other things, identifying medical supplies and equipment whose market prices have increased by more than 15 percent, and requires suppliers to prioritize federal contracts. The struggle between governors and mayors about loosening restrictions related to the novel coronavirus pandemic has played out this week as plans to restart tumbling economies were unveiled. In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) announced a three-tiered approach Wednesday to allow businesses to begin reopening their doors, starting Friday for some. But in the state\u2019s largest (Oklahoma City) and third-largest (Norman) cities, stay-at-home guidelines will remain in place through next week. \u201c We dearly hope that public health data allows Oklahoma City to consider entering that new phase on May 1 as the governor has envisioned,\u201d Mayor David Holt said in a statement. \u201cWe have one shot at managing this pandemic,\u201d Norman Mayor Breea Clark  told Fox 25 , \u201cand we\u2019re blowing it.\u201d  Stitt\u2019s order will allow personal care businesses, such as salons, barber shops and spas, to reopen Friday, though by appointment only and maintaining the state\u2019s health guidelines. Churches, restaurant dining rooms and movie theaters will follow suit May 1. They, too, will have to adhere to state guidelines. There is no timetable yet to reopen the state Capitol in Oklahoma City. Holt  told the Oklahoman  that, while he has taken necessary steps \u201cto save the lives of our people,\u201d he sees \u201cno reason to believe we will not be in alignment with the governor.\u201d  Oklahoma reported nine pandemic-related deaths Thursday, three more than the previous day and 179 overall. The number of confirmed cases jumped to 123 Thursday from 87 Wednesday, for a total of 3,017. In Georgia, several mayors have expressed concern about Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s announcement Monday that the state will begin to reopen Friday. Kemp\u2019s orders do not meet White House standards for lifting restrictions, and the mayors said they were not consulted. President Trump said he disagrees with the Republican governor\u2019s action. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she \u201cwill continue to urge Atlanta to stay at home, stay safe and make decisions based on the best interests of their families.\u201d  Rick Bright, the scientist who said he was removed as the leader of the federal agency working on a coronavirus vaccine, is filing a whistleblower\u2019s complaint, his attorneys said Thursday. \u201cIn our filing we will make clear that Dr. Bright was sidelined for one reason only \u2014 because he resisted efforts to provide unfettered access to potentially dangerous drugs, including chloroquine, a drug promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which is untested and possibly deadly when used improperly,\u201d Debra S. Katz and Lisa J. Banks said in a written statement. Bright said he was removed Tuesday as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA, and \u201cinvoluntarily transferred to a more limited and less impactful position at the National Institutes of Health.\u201d President Trump said Wednesday that he had never heard of Bright. Bright\u2019s attorneys said the complaint will be filed with the Office of Special Counsel and the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services. It will detail, they said, \u201cthe retaliatory treatment to which he was subjected by HHS political leadership after raising appropriate science-based concerns about White House pressure on treatment and vaccines related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d Some 129 Haitian deportees from the United States landed in Port-au-Prince, the country\u2019s capital, on Thursday, sent on a flight from the U.S. despite evidence that some of them were exposed to the coronavirus in a U.S. detention center, according to the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, a nongovernmental organization. \u201cThe U.S. is deporting all over the Americas without testing to see who may have picked up the virus in crowded ICE detention facilities,\u201d said Steve Forester, the institute\u2019s immigration policy coordinator. \u201cThat\u2019s unconscionable and a deadly time bomb for the receiving nations.\u201d Haitian officials told HuffPost, which  first reported  the planned deportations, that they feared that the continued arrival of deportees from the United States could exacerbate the virus\u2019s spread in the country, which has a health system that  would buckle  under a severe outbreak. A previous U.S. flight carrying 68 deportees arrived April 7 in Haiti,  amid reports  that at least one passenger had been exposed to the coronavirus. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not immediately available to comment on the most recent deportations. Developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have expressed concern over the U.S. refusal to halt deportations. The Post  reported  that while U.S. officials say they screen migrants before a slated departure, they have not committed to administering tests. The House voted to approve the creation of a new subcommittee to oversee the Trump administration\u2019s disbursement of $2 trillion in coronavirus relief funds and its response to the pandemic. No Republicans voted in favor of the new panel, which passed along party lines, 212 to 182. Democrats argued that it was essential that they be able to track the federal dollars and hold the White House to account. Republicans said it duplicated efforts of other government officials already tasked with oversight of the money. The 12-member committee will have the authority to subpoena Trump officials and take depositions. Republicans accused Democrats of creating the panel as a political tool to go after Trump. The vote, which was scheduled to last 15 minutes, stretched more than an hour and a half because of the special precautions taken to minimize how many lawmakers were in the chamber at the same time.

Blue-chip stocks climbed during a scattershot session Thursday as investors latched onto a recovery in oil prices and ignored another week of daunting job losses due to the coronavirus crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average popped more than 300 points in the morning before paring its advance to 39 points, less than 0.2 percent. The broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended nearly flat. Roughly half of the 30 Dow blue chips were in the positive column, led by oil supermajors Chevron and ExxonMobil. Oil prices were on a tear after a wild two-day slide early in the week sent the price for U.S. crude below zero \u2014 meaning sellers paid people to take the oil. By Thursday, however, prices had come back 40 percent. Wall Street showed little reaction Thursday after the U.S. Labor Department reported that 4.4 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing to 26.5 million the number of jobs lost since the pandemic took hold in the United States.

The death toll in California is now at 1,469, according to Newsom. \u201cIt was the deadliest day in the state of California,\u201d Newsom said of the past 24 hours  during his daily address . \u201cI don\u2019t say that lightly and I don\u2019t say that certainly cheerfully \u2026 each one of those numbers represents a family, represents a life lost and a journey that their family will be on and their loved ones will be on that predates the passing of that loved one.\u201d  Newsom said California saw an 8.5 percent increase in the total number of deaths in that 24-hour period and also a 5.6 percent increase in people who have tested positive in the state. California now has more than 37,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Newsom. Of those cases, 3,343 are in hospitals and 1,204 are in the ICU. \u201cIt\u2019s also a reminder we\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d Newsom said. Despite the somber news, Newsom also noted a slight decrease in the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus (a .4 percent decline) and ICU patients (a 1.2 percent decline) in his daily address. He said \u201cPUIs,\u201d or people under investigation who are suspected to have coronavirus, have also declined. Addressing the first \u201cnice weekend since January or last summer in the state of California,\u201d Newsom also emphasized the importance of social distancing and wearing facial coverings in grocery stores and elsewhere as the pandemic continues. Two chain restaurants, Kura Sushi USA and Sweetgreen, have joined Shake Shack in agreeing to return federal small-business loans after outrage from small-business advocates and policymakers over national restaurant and hotel companies  obtaining millions in funds  from the program before it ran dry last week. Kura Sushi USA canceled a  $5.98 million  federal small-business loan. In a statement that the company posted on its  website , president and CEO Jimmy Uba said Kura Sushi played by the rules set out by lawmakers but had no idea how intense the competition for funding would be. Read more  here : A new survey shows that 60 percent of Americans think Trump should listen to public health experts more as he crafts the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. The  poll  by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research also shows that most Americans continue to disapprove of the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Only 41 percent of respondents said they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, compared with 43 percent who said so in March. Americans are more likely to get their information on the pandemic from their state or local government (50 percent) as opposed to from Trump (28 percent), according to the survey. The poll, which was conducted April 16-20, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. In a series of deleted tweets  unearthed by CNN , incoming Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Michael Caputo made racist comments about Chinese people, claimed Democrats wanted the coronavirus to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans, and accused the media of creating panic to stop President Trump. Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide who was fired after posting a celebratory tweet about the firing of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, deleted almost his entire Twitter history after being tapped for the new role last week. CNN said it used the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine to comb through 1,300 deleted tweets from late February to early April. \u201cIn a series of tweets on March 12, Caputo responded to a baseless conspiracy theory that the United States brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, China, by tweeting that \u2018millions of Chinese suck the blood out of rabid bats as an appetizer and eat the ass out of anteaters,\u2019\u201d the network reported. \u201cHe followed up at another user, \u2018Don\u2019t you have a bat to eat?\u2019 and tweeted at another user, \u2018You\u2019re very convincing, Wang.\u2019\u201d On March 8, CNN reported, Caputo questioned whether a Democrat might try to cause American deaths from the coronavirus, pointing to James Hodgkinson, the anti-Trump shooter who  targeted GOP Congress lawmakers during a 2017 baseball practice . \u201cCoronavirus is the Democrats\u2019 new Russia, their new Ukraine,\u201d Caputo tweeted, according to CNN. \u201cAnd nobody will believe them except their zombies. But know this: The Dems\u2019 strategy to defeat @realDonaldTrump requires 100s of thousands of American deaths. Will one of their nutjobs make it happen, a la Hodgkinson?\u201d In other March tweets highlighted by CNN, he claimed the media created \u201cintentional\u201d panic around the coronavirus outbreak, adding that it was \u201corchestrated by soulless Trump critics who seize every crisis as an opportunity to stop him.\u201d The network said Caputo and HHS did not respond to requests for comment, while the White House declined to address the tweets.

One big part of ESPN\u2019s NFL draft coverage will be missing when the first round begins Thursday night. Todd McShay announced Thursday afternoon that he\u2019s \u201chome recovering from coronavirus\u201d and won\u2019t be analyzing players alongside Mel Kiper Jr. as the NFL\u2019s 32 teams make their picks. This year\u2019s draft was already on a strange track because of the virus, and McShay\u2019s absence adds to the surreal atmosphere. The draft is being conducted remotely rather than in Las Vegas, with Commissioner Roger Goodell joining from his Bronxville, N.Y., basement in a joint production of the sports network and the NFL Network. Read more  here . Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards joined other governors Thursday in condemning a suggestion by Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) that states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy rather than receive federal aid to help fill budget holes caused by the pandemic. \u201cThat is grossly irresponsible,\u201d Edwards (D) said during his daily briefing early Thursday afternoon. \u201cIt would just be horrendous for states to have to declare bankruptcy.\u201d  Edwards said \u201cthe much better approach\u201d is reflected in a bipartisan bill introduced by Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) that would appropriate about $500 billion in stimulus, with much of the money going to the states, with flexibility to let them use the money to bolster budgets. \u201cThat is obviously a much more responsible path forward,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m heartened to say that publicly the president has agreed that in the next phase of coronavirus relief coming out of Congress that states should be included. So I\u2019m hopeful that the president\u2019s view wins out and that Sen. McConnell has a change of heart on this.\u201d  A 35-year-old Singaporean woman has been arrested for allegedly leaking daily coronavirus numbers before their official release, Singaporean  news organizations  reported Thursday, citing an announcement by police. According to the reports, at 7:43 p.m. on April 16, 2020, police received a tip from a member of the public that the day\u2019s daily tally of confirmed cases of coronavirus had appeared on an Instagram story post before publication by the Ministry of Health. The woman, a civil servant who was permitted access to the daily numbers before their official release, had shared the numbers several times with members of a private WeChat group, according to preliminary investigations. Singapore\u2019s  laws warn of harsh punishment  for those who spread misinformation during the novel coronavirus pandemic. However, this case involves the spread of information the government deems accurate. Local news outlet  Mothership.sg  reported that under the offense of wrongful communication of information, part of the Official Secrets Act, the act may be subject to a fine of as much as $1,400 and imprisonment for up to two years. Singapore, once held up as a model of epidemic control during the novel coronavirus, has seen a rash of new cases, often linked to  the large local population  of low-paid foreign workers who the government overlooked in initial planning. Case numbers in the country have surged past 9,000 in recent days, forcing the country to extend a lockdown that was belatedly imposed at the start of April. On April 16, the day in question, the  Singaporean Health Ministry  had announced a record high of 728 new cases, bringing the total in the country to more than 4,000. The Navy announced Thursday that coronavirus testing has been completed for every crew member on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, confirming more than 800 cases of infection among people from the stricken aircraft carrier. The situation aboard the vessel has  spiraled into a crisis for the Navy , resulting first in the  ouster  of the ship\u2019s commander and then  the resignation of the acting Navy secretary . One sailor from the vessel who contracted the virus died, becoming  the first active-duty military death  caused by the virus. The Navy said Thursday that 840 crew members had tested positive, while more than 4,000 tested negative. Four sailors from the ship were at U.S. Naval Hospital Guam being treated for virus symptoms, it added. As a coronavirus outbreak began to spread across the ship, Capt. Brett Crozier, the ship\u2019s commander, pleaded with the Navy to evacuate most of those on board. His written message was eventually leaked publicly, and acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly  removed him  from command. Modly then went to Guam and gave a speech to the carrier\u2019s crew, during which  he insulted Crozier . That audio was leaked, and Modly resigned not long after.

Western European countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic announced hundreds of new deaths on Thursday as experts warned that many of the same countries were not accounting for all coronavirus-related fatalities. France announced 516 coronavirus deaths, bringing its total death toll to 21,856. In Italy, deaths increased by 464 to 25,549, adding to the largest death toll outside the United States. Britain announced an increase of 616 deaths to 18,738 in total, while Spain earlier in the day announced 440 fatalities, bringing its total number of deaths to 22,157. All four countries appear to be past the first wave of deaths. Officials in Italy and France have pointed toward another encouraging indicator: The numbers of patients in intensive care are falling. But experts have questioned whether the daily tallies released capture the full impact of the outbreaks. Analyses have suggested that many deaths occur in facilities for the elderly or vulnerable, or at home, and that these deaths may not be counted as easily as deaths in hospitals. Speaking on Wednesday, Hans Kluge, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Europe, said evidence from European nations suggested that as many as half of those who have died of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, were probably residents of long-term-care facilities. A study  by the Financial Times  this week estimated that the true coronavirus death toll in Britain was probably as high as 41,000, citing government figures that showed a large increase in the number of deaths over a yearly average. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at a briefing on Thursday there was a \u201chuge effort underway to limit the spread in care homes,\u201d including expanded testing in facilities. Georgia health officials reported Thursday a weekly increase in both the state\u2019s death toll and confirmed novel coronavirus cases, numbers that came  amid controversy  over the governor\u2019s decision to allow businesses to reopen starting Friday. On Thursday, the Georgia Department of Public Health reported that the death toll had risen to 872 \u2014 nearly 100 more  than confirmed Monday , the day Gov. Brian Kemp (R) announced his plans. The number of confirmed virus cases also climbed to over 21,500, which was more than 2,000 higher than what the state  reported Monday . The health department noted its data can have a reporting lag. Kemp\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the numbers. On Wednesday, President Trump said he disagreed with Kemp\u2019s move to allow small businesses \u2014 including gyms and hair salons \u2014 to reopen. \u201cI want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Trump said at a White House briefing. Kemp defended his decisions,  posting on Twitter  that he spoke to Trump about his plans, while praising the president\u2019s \u201cbold leadership and insight during these difficult times.\u201d \u201cOur next measured step is driven by data and guided by state public health officials,\u201d Kemp tweeted. \u201cWe will continue with this approach to protect the lives \u2014 and livelihoods \u2014 of all Georgians.\u201d The plans spurred pushback from some  local business owners  and elected officials, including mayors. \u201cWhen you\u2019re telling people to still stay at home, but yet we\u2019re going to open certain businesses, that creates a problem in which people are not sure what to do,\u201d Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), who is running for the Senate after Kemp passed him over for an open seat,  said Thursda y on Fox News. As debates continued in the House on Thursday over a $484 billion economic relief bill, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) shared that the legislation has a special meaning for her. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a moment to dedicate this legislation to my dear sister, who is dying in a hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, right now, infected by the coronavirus,\u201d Waters said in remarks on the House floor. She noted that the legislation includes more funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing, in addition to funding to replenish a small business loan fund. Water, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, urged her colleagues to start immediately thinking about next steps to help the country recover economically. \u201cWe need to do much more to help renters, homeowners, people experiencing homelessness and mom and pop landlords,\u201d she said. Preliminary results from a study in New York state found that nearly 14 percent of 3,000 people tested had developed antibodies to fight the coronavirus, suggesting they were previously infected, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said Thursday. He also announced that the state recorded another \u201cbreathtakingly tragic\u201d 438 deaths on Wednesday, continuing a downward trend. Hospitalization and intubation rates were also down, Cuomo said, while new cases had flattened at about 1,300 a day \u2014 a number the governor called \u201cnot great.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d like to see those new cases reducing even more,\u201d he said, noting these tallies are the best indicator of how containment is working. \u201cAnd we\u2019d like to see them reducing faster.\u201d The antibody study started several days ago and was aimed at determining the infection rate. Cuomo called it the \u201clargest, most comprehensive study of New York state.\u201d So far, the study has put that rate at 13.9 percent, which would indicate that 2.7 million New Yorkers have contracted the virus. This in turn could signal a lower than expected death rate at about 0.5 percent. But Cuomo cautioned there are major caveats. The tests were given at grocery and other big-box stores and thus include only people who were out in public rather than staying home. Additionally, the true mortality rate from covid-19 is not known because current calculations exclude deaths that occur at home and account for only those in hospitals and nursing homes. New York City alone has estimated at least an additional 5,000 coronavirus-related deaths, which are currently classified as \u201cprobable.\u201d The official figure \u201cis not an accurate total number of deaths,\u201d Cuomo said. The study found that 21 percent of New York City residents who were tested came back positive for the coronavirus antibodies. The rate of infections was higher among minorities, with 22 percent of black people and 22 percent of Hispanic people testing positive, compared with 9 percent of white people. Cuomo noted, however, that 43 percent of tests were conducted in New York City, which is more racially diverse than the rest of the state. He said this could have affected the racial breakdown. Testing for the study, he said, will continue on a rolling basis. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) drew flak Thursday from governors in both parties after suggesting that states hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak should be allowed to seek bankruptcy protections rather than be given a federal bailout. McConnell\u2019s comments, made during a radio interview on Wednesday, came amid a renewed push from states for help from Washington to cover lost tax revenue that has been among the dire consequences of the ongoing pandemic. \u201cThis is really one of the dumb ideas of all time,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said during a briefing in Albany in which he warned that bankruptcy declarations by multiple states would lead to \u201ca collapse of this national economy.\u201d  Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), chairman of the bipartisan National Governors Association, which has asked McConnell for $500 billion to help states deal with lost revenue, said McConnell \u201cprobably regrets saying that.\u201d  Read more  here . The World Health Organization warned Thursday that sub-Saharan Africa could see a dramatic uptick in malaria deaths this year if the coronavirus pandemic prevents health workers from distributing lifesaving supplies to the most vulnerable populations. Around 228 million people  contracted malaria  in 2018, and at least 405,000 people died of the disease. The vast majority were in Africa. That year, more than 60 percent of malaria deaths worldwide were in children under the age of five. New WHO models suggest that in a worst-case scenario, as many as 769,000 people could die of the mosquito-borne illness in sub-Saharan Africa this year if access to bed nets and medications is disrupted. \u201cA recent analysis has found that if insecticide-treated bed net distribution stops, and case management reduces, malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double in comparison to 2018,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, who leads the WHO\u2019s work across most countries in Africa,  said at a news conference  Thursday. She warned the death toll could reach the highest \u201cseen in the region since the year 2000.\u201d Moeti said that researchers found an increase in malaria deaths during recent Ebola outbreaks, when access to health care for other illnesses became more limited and health workers faced hurdles carrying out campaigns advertising preventive measures. \u201cLet us not repeat that again with covid-19,\u201d Moeti said. \u201cWe must not turn back the clock.\u201d Conservative economist Stephen Moore said Thursday that his suggestion that Americans don space suits amid the coronavirus pandemic was \u201ckind of a joke.\u201d In an  interview  with the New York Times, Moore had said, \u201cI was thinking this morning, and this is just kind of a thought experiment because I was thinking about this \u2014 why don\u2019t we just put everybody in a space outfit or something like that?\u201d In the interview, Moore noted that \u201cwe don\u2019t have space outfits\u201d for hundreds of millions of Americans at the moment. But he added that \u201cthere are all these kinds of suits that they\u2019re building now that you\u2019re not exposed\u201d to the air. Moore, who is a member of the White House council to reopen the country and  a coalition of conservatives  pushing for the relaxation of stay-at-home orders, clarified Thursday in an email to The Washington Post that he raised the idea somewhat jokingly and that \u201cmaybe space suit isn\u2019t [the] best way to describe it.\u201d \u201cI was making the point that we need to use the best safety measures \u2014 masks, gloves, etc. \u2014 to get the economy opened,\u201d Moore said. He added that the idea of \u201csome kind of protective suit where people are not exposed to germs\u201d might be worth exploring. \u201cPeople won\u2019t go back to work until they feel absolutely safe,\u201d he said.

London \u2014 The New Zealand nurse name-checked by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for helping to save his life said that the British leader was \u201cjust another patient.\u201d When Johnson left the hospital this month, he paid special tribute to two nurses, \u201cJenny from New Zealand\u201d and \u201cLuis from Portugal,\u201d who stood by his bedside for 48 hours when \u201cthings could have gone either way,\u201d he said. Jenny McGee, who has worked in intensive care in Britain for 10 years,  told Television New Zealand  that Johnson didn\u2019t get special treatment because of his status. He was \u201cjust another patient we were trying to do our best for.\u201d Johnson, who was sick with covid-19, spent three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen. He is recovering at Chequers, the country residence of the British prime minister. \u201cWe take it very seriously who comes into intensive care,\u201d said McGee. \u201cThese patients who come into us, it\u2019s a very scary thing for them, so we don\u2019t take it lightly, and he absolutely needed to be there.\u201d McGee said that she was surprised to be thanked by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, as well. The two exchanged messages, banter and emoji over Facebook, she said, describing it as a \u201csurreal experience.\u201d Luis Pitarma, originally from Portugal,  issued a statement  Thursday that he was by Johnson\u2019s side for three nights and that before the prime minister left the unit, he \u201cthanked me for saving his life.\u201d \u201cHe was also a patient like any other patient, a life like any other life,\u201d Pitarma said. The nurse said he was unsure of what to call the British leader, who in turn told him to address him simply as \u201cBoris.\u201d The governors of Maryland and Virginia and the mayor of D.C. on Thursday urged the Trump administration to continue allowing federal employees to work remotely. In a letter to the acting director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the regional leaders asked the government to maintain coronavirus telework policies. They noted that the reopening guidance released by the White House last week instructed employers to encourage telework in the first phases of recovery. \u201cWhile of course any essential employee should continue to report to work, we know that a continued federal telework policy will help save lives by allowing more of our region\u2019s 360,000 federal employees to work from home,\u201d wrote Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). All three jurisdictions have restrictions in place until at least mid-May. Officials say that social distancing measures have been working but that hospitals could become overwhelmed if they abruptly cancel stay-at-home orders and business closures. \u201cWe encourage the Administration to help ensure the safety of the federal workforce and our residents as we work together to fight this pandemic,\u201d the executives wrote. \u201cFailure to do so could lead to a rise in cases and delay our ability to reopen the region.\u201d A  memo issued this week  by the OMB and the Office of Personnel Management said federal officials will \u201cramp back up government operations to the maximum extent possible, as local conditions warrant.\u201d Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

The House prepared Thursday to pass a bipartisan $484 billion spending package that would restart a small-business loan program that was swamped by demand and allocate more money for health-care providers and coronavirus testing. The House vote would send the legislation to Trump for enactment, following  Senate approval  earlier this week. Lawmakers from both parties are already talking about pursuing more large spending bills to try to contain the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout, but the measure Thursday could be the last one for at least several weeks. The vote came after the  Labor Department reported  that more than 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. More than 26 million Americans have been laid off or furloughed in a little more than a month as the coronavirus sends the economy into a tailspin. Many businesses are shuttered, and state leaders have begun an uneven process of trying to plan when to relax certain restrictions. Read more  here . NEW DELHI \u2014 On a bright morning this month, a former army officer was riding his motorcycle down a rural road south of India\u2019s capital when he reached an improvised barricade. He had no idea the villagers were looking for a scapegoat. He slowed his bike to a stop. The men at the barricade quickly identified him as a Muslim from the neighboring area in the state of Haryana. \u201cThese people are spreading the  coronavirus ,\u201d said one of the villagers, according to a police complaint filed by the man\u2019s family. \u201cGrab him.\u201d The ensuing assault reflected one of the oldest \u2014 and ugliest \u2014 human impulses: the desire to blame calamity on those who are different. In India, the search for scapegoats during the coronavirus pandemic has focused squarely on the country\u2019s sizable Muslim minority, a community of 200 million that felt under threat even before the advent of covid-19.

McDaniel, 60, who died April 15 after testing positive for the virus. But his wife, Lisa McDaniel, told friends and family in a  letter  published by the Snyder Funeral Home in Marion, Ohio, that his Wednesday funeral would instead be privately recorded after her family endured a deluge of angry and even mocking messages from strangers upset that he had described the coronavirus outbreak as a \u201c political ploy .\u201d \u201cDuring this time of mourning, John\u2019s story, along with early assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook have turned into national news,\u201d Lisa McDaniel wrote. \u201cThis news has opened the floodgates for people to share their own misguided anger and unfounded assumptions about a man they don\u2019t know.\u201d Read more  here . A Brazilian city in the Amazon rainforest is burying coronavirus victims in mass graves and running out of ventilators in its hospitals, spurring fears it is on track to become the next hot spot for the virus in South America. Manaus, home to 2.2 million people and surrounded mostly by jungle, was already suffering from a strained health-care system, with limited equipment and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. But as social distancing measures are ignored and bodies pile up, hospitals appear to be reaching a breaking point. More than 1,700 infections, including at least 156 deaths, had been reported in the city as of Tuesday,  according to  the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, although health experts say official numbers vastly underrepresent the spread of the virus. Videos circulating on social media showed scenes inside the city\u2019s Jo\u00e3o L\u00facio Hospital reminiscent of the hardest-hit facilities in Wuhan, New York or Milan, the Associated Press  reported . Body bags sat on gurneys in the hallway or on beds next to patients undergoing treatment. Outside, workers loaded corpses into a refrigerated container installed next to the hospital. The number of burials at the city\u2019s largest cemetery, Nossa Senhora Aparecida, have tripled, with more than a hundred bodies to inter every day, Folha reported. Coffins are buried side-by-side in what city officials have dubbed \u201ctrenches,\u201d an arrangement they say still allows for graves to be identified. As President Jair Bolsonaro ignores the recommendations of health experts and  encourages Brazilians to return to work , many worry the crumbling situation in Manaus offers a grim vision of the future for the rest of the country. Last week, Bolsonaro fired his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after the two sparred publicly over an outbreak the president has  derided  as a \u201clittle flu\u201d and a \u201cfantasy.\u201d On Thursday, one of Bolsonaro\u2019s allies in his government, Gen. Luiz Eduardo Ramos, urged reporters to stop disseminating images of coffins and graves. \u201cOn the morning news, it\u2019s coffins, it\u2019s bodies,\u201d Ramos said,  the Guardian  reported. \u201cOn the lunchtime news, it\u2019s coffins, it\u2019s bodies, and it\u2019s the number of deaths. I ask everyone, how do you think an older lady, a poor person, or a fragile person feels \u2026 It\u2019s not helping.\u201d As governors across the country weigh how quickly to reopen their economies, new polling suggests most Americans remain hesitant to venture out to some places amid persistent concerns about the coronavirus. Only 13 percent, for instance, would be comfortable going to a large sports or entertainment event if a stay-at-home order were lifted now, according to  the CBS News survey . Similarly, only 15 percent of Americans would be comfortable getting on an airplane, while 29 percent say they are ready to go to restaurants or bars. Fewer than half \u2014 44 percent \u2014 say they would be comfortable going to a workplace outside the home. Meanwhile, 54 percent say they would be comfortable visiting friends if a stay-at-home order were lifted now.

In a different year, incoming freshmen would already have a tightly choreographed schedule for late summer and early fall: the move-in date, the orientation and, finally, the first day of classes. But on the pandemic calendar, there are no dates yet for the next academic year. Just scenarios. And that unprecedented uncertainty is fueling a second wave of crisis for schools already plunged into financial distress. Colleges and universities are gaming out whether, when and how they can reopen campuses after the  abrupt shutdowns in March . Support from governors is essential but is hardly the only factor. Every prospective and returning student is hanging on the answers. Read more  here . President Trump said his administration  is preparing to reopen national parks  that were closed to help stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to open our country again,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. Yet Trump was not clear about which parks would reopen, or when, sparking fears that a rushed return to normal operations could lead to more infections among park workers, visitors and residents in neighboring communities. Theresa Pierno, head of the National Parks Conservation Association, said her organization has heard from park staff who feel that they do not have the proper personal protective equipment to work while there\u2019s still a threat from the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 and do not know when they will get it. \u201cAt many of our national parks, social distancing has already proven to be nearly impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that until it\u2019s safe, parks already closed should remain so.\u201d The president\u2019s team said any reopening would happen \u201cgradually\u201d and in coordination with the states.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Thursday that her oldest brother died of covid-19 in Oklahoma. \u201cMy oldest brother, Don Reed, died from coronavirus on Tuesday evening,\u201d Warren said in a  tweet , in which she also shared a  Boston Globe story  about her brother\u2019s death. \u201cHe joined the Air Force at 19 and spent his career in the military, including five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam. He was charming and funny, a natural leader.\u201d Donald Reed Herring was 86 and died of covid-19 three weeks after testing positive for the disease, according to the Globe. Warren, who ended her presidential campaign last month, frequently talked about her three older brothers on the campaign trail. I\u2019m grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him, but it\u2019s hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say \u201cI love you\u201d one more time\u2014and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close. I'll miss you dearly my brother.  pic.twitter.com/oOG6HArEL6 Members of the House donned face masks Thursday as they took to the floor to debate a $484 billion coronavirus relief package that is expected to pass later in the day. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), wore plain blue face masks. Others, including Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), wore masks showing pride for their local sports teams. McGovern was seen addressing the chamber while wearing a New England Patriots mask. In what appeared to be a first, the House chaplain, reading clerk and other staff members also wore masks while they were on the House floor. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke in favor of a new select oversight committee in a floor speech Thursday morning. As she waited by the podium for Democrats to speak, Pelosi kept a white scarf wrapped around her head, with a set of hand wipes and paper towels at her side. When her turn came, Pelosi pulled the scarf down so she could speak more clearly into her microphone. After she finished, Cole, the Republican managing the debate, thanked Pelosi for setting a standard in which a lawmaker should wear a face covering around the Capitol but, while speaking, could take off the mask. Most speakers are now following that lead. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access. MEXICO CITY \u2014 The Mexican economy was already in recession, having contracted in 2019 for the first time in a decade and projecting more losses in 2020. The peso was among the worst-performing currencies in the world. Then came the  coronavirus . The pandemic is wreaking financial havoc everywhere. But in Mexico, it\u2019s taking specific aim at the pillars of the Mexican economy: trade, oil, remittances and tourism.

People are ready to get going again.  \u201cUnfortunately, although we have the will, we don\u2019t have the way \u2014 not yet.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 200 points, or nearly 0.9 percent, within minutes of the opening bell. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 and Nasdaq composite also advanced. The gains come after the Labor Department reported that 4.4 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing to 26.5 million the number of jobs lost due to the  coronavirus  recession. After a wild two-day slide that sent prices into negative territory earlier this week, oil was on the upswing. West Texas intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, shot up nearly 24 percent, to $17 a barrel on Thursday. The global benchmark, Brent crude, jumped more than 8 percent, to $22 a barrel. Read more  here . Former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Thursday he did not believe the White House was involved in the dismissal of leading vaccine expert Rick Bright, who claimed he was ousted after resisting President Trump\u2019s push to use the unproven drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment. \u201cI doubt anyone in the White House was aware that Rick Bright was being moved out of that role until they read about it in the newspaper,\u201d Gottlieb said during an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cI suspect this decision was made within the health department, and the White House was not involved in any fashion.\u201d Bright said in a Wednesday statement that he was removed from his role as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority after he pushed back against pressure to funnel money into hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug Trump has touted as a \u201cpotential game-changer.\u201d A  recent study found it had no benefit  in treating covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and was linked to higher rates of death among patients hospitalized with the virus. \u201cI believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,\u201d Bright said in his statement,  first reported by the New York Times . \u201cI am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science \u2014 not politics or cronyism \u2014 has to lead the way.\u201d During Thursday\u2019s interview, Gottlieb suggested Bright\u2019s move to a narrower National Institutes of Health role might be \u201cmore complicated\u201d than it appeared. But he also voiced support for Bright\u2019s work. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to have continuity in that BARDA position, and Rick was doing a good job,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cI worked very closely with him. And so I would have liked to see him remain in that role.\u201d The top elected official in Harris County, Tex., told the jurisdiction\u2019s 4.7 million residents on Wednesday that they will have to wear face masks for a month in an effort to fight the coronavirus \u2014 a move that some GOP officials in the state labeled \u201ctyranny\u201d and \u201cgovernment overreach.\u201d  This dispute is the latest example of divided rhetoric from local, state and federal leaders amid the pandemic, a period of conflicting, sometimes contradictory, guidance from officials about what measures need to be taken and for how long. In Harris County, the latest version of this fight took shape around face masks \u2014 coverings that officials and the federal government have recently  begun urging or requiring people to wear . Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in the country\u2019s third-largest county, said she  signed an order  Wednesday requiring face coverings in public for 30 days. Hidalgo, a Democrat who took office last year, said she was not requiring people to wear medical masks, but just to cover their mouths and noses. Dan Patrick, the state\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, blasted Hidalgo\u2019s move. \u201cHer abuse of the use of executive orders is the ultimate government overreach,\u201d Patrick said in a  statement . \u201cThese kind of confused government policies fuel public anger \u2014 and rightfully so.\u201d  Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) chimed in, saying on  Twitter  that guidelines for wearing masks in confined spaces should be promoted but not punished with jail time or fines, writing: \u201cDo not let commonsense guidelines lead to unjust tyranny.\u201d  Hidalgo  has said  people are entitled to their opinions but that the masks are needed to protect people. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) has condemned an anti-Semitic sign displayed during a protest of the state\u2019s stay-at-home order, as well as a Republican state senator\u2019s statement that he would not allow the Ohio Department of Health director, who is Jewish, to turn the state into Nazi Germany. \u201cWhile even disgusting speech is constitutionally protected, it still demands condemnation,\u201d DeWine said in the  first of several tweets  posted late Wednesday. The sign, featuring a drawing of a rat with a Star of David under the words \u201cThe real plague,\u201d was \u201cvile and disgusting,\u201d DeWine said. His tweets then turned to a recent Facebook comment by Ohio state Sen. Andrew Brenner, which DeWine described as \u201clikening Ohio\u2019s Department of Health Director\u2019s actions to fight coronavirus to those taken by the Nazis in Germany during World War II.\u201d Brenner\u2019s remark \u201cmust also be condemned,\u201d DeWine wrote. The governor was referring to a Facebook comment that the GOP state senator made in response to a post from his wife, Sara Marie Brenner , according to the Columbus Dispatch . Her post included a photo of Health Director Amy Acton and a comment she made expressing interest in a measure that some countries have taken to issue certificates to people considered immune to the virus. \u201cThis actually feels like Hitler\u2019s Germany where you had to have blond hair and blue eyes to be able to function anywhere, and you were damned otherwise,\u201d Sara Marie Brenner wrote, according to the paper. \u201cWhen are people going to say enough is enough?\u201d The senator, who  previously expressed support for the state\u2019s actions , replied, \u201cWe won\u2019t allow that to happen in Ohio.\u201d \u201cThe comments showed a complete lack of understanding of the Holocaust \u2014 made even more offensive by posting on Holocaust Memorial Day \u2014 and was a slur on a good, compassionate, and honorable person who has worked non-stop to save lives and protect her fellow citizens,\u201d DeWine tweeted. Brenner apologized to Acton but claimed that his words had been twisted, the Dispatch reported. \u201cIt is unfortunate comments meant to show concern about potentially putting in place health standards that are too stringent were smeared into an insensitive political attack on the director,\u201d he said.

Atop a shaded hill at the edge of S\u00e3o Paulo, the gravedigger thinks he knows the truth. No matter how bad it appears in Brazil \u2014 the country hit hardest by the  coronavirus  in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 the reality is significantly worse. The cemetery now receives around 50 bodies every day \u2014 double the average in normal times. Many are marked as confirmed cases of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. But many more say only unidentified respiratory ailment. Imprecise and insufficient testing is a global problem, but in Brazil, it\u2019s on an entirely different scale. Latin America\u2019s largest country is testing people at a rate far lower than any other nation with at least 40,000 cases. It tests 12 times fewer people than Iran. Read more  here . Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday pushed for an independent review of the coronavirus pandemic, which Morrison said should be supported by all World Health Organization (WHO) members. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a member of a club like the World Health Organization, there should be responsibilities and obligations attached to that,\u201d  Morrison said. The move prompted a response from China\u2019s foreign ministry, with spokesman Geng Shuang suggesting Morrison\u2019s move was motivated by \u201cideological bias\u201d and it would be unpopular and irresponsible to force an investigation while the pandemic was still raging. China has so far resisted an inquiry, framing criticism of its initial handling of the crisis as a propaganda effort by the Trump administration and its allies, including Morrison\u2019s government. Trump stoked controversy last week when he announced abruptly he would halt U.S. funding to the WHO, citing concerns over its handling of the outbreak and calling the organization \u201cChina-centric.\u201d  Even though Australia heavily depends on trade with China, diplomatic relations are strained and could further deteriorate as Morrison positions himself as a key critic of Beijing during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite Morrison\u2019s efforts, his eagerness to launch a review at this stage in the pandemic has been met with resistance in several European capitals. While French President Emmanuel Macron said last week there \u201care clearly things that have happened [in China] that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d Macron has rejected calls for an investigation saying now is not the right time, according to a French official speaking to Reuters. Britain similarly responded the current focus should be on combating the pandemic. U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres  acknowledged last week  that once \u201cwe have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis.\u201d But he added, \u201cNow is not that time.\u201d  Siobh\u00e1n O\u2019Grady contributed to this report. When Carolyn Goodman began her week, the independent mayor of Las Vegas probably did not anticipate that in a matter of days she would become one of the most talked-about public officials in the national conversation surrounding the novel coronavirus pandemic.

It all stemmed from a pair of remarkable TV appearances \u2014 first on Tuesday with MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur and then Wednesday with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, in which she doubled down on her  head-scratching plan  to reopen the city\u2019s casinos and hotels with no apparent guidelines in place to ensure safety.

SEOUL \u2014 China has committed $30 million to the World Health Organization one week after President Trump halted U.S. funding to the United Nations agency that has emerged as a battleground for influence between the two powers. Trump last week announced his intention to freeze U.S. contributions after slamming the global body as having \u201cfailed in its basic duty\u201d to respond quickly to the  coronavirus  outbreak because of deference to Beijing. In announcing the donation Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang defended the WHO and said the agency under the leadership of Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been \u201cactively fulfilling its duties and upholding an objective, scientific and impartial stance.\u201d Read more  here . More than 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the Labor Department, a signal that the tidal wave of job losses continues to grow. The new total comes on top of 22 million Americans who had sought benefits in previous weeks, overwhelming state processing systems. The velocity of job losses since March is unprecedented. Economists estimate that the national unemployment rate sits between 15 and 20 percent, much higher than it was during the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. The unemployment rate at the peak of the Great Depression was about 25 percent. Read more  here . During the despair of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt established ambitious federally funded jobs programs directly aimed at buoying young people. Now, in the midst of the historic coronavirus pandemic, there\u2019s a growing consensus among U.S. lawmakers and policy wonks that young millennials and their Generation Z counterparts need the same kind of aggressive government boost. But historians doubt any government intervention of the kind that helped lift a generation of young people out of poverty in the 1930s would be workable today. Conspicuously left out of the $2 trillion stimulus package, most high school seniors and many college students are not eligible for broad financial assistance from the government to help them dig out of the pandemic\u2019s economic hole.

When the coronavirus roared through the claustrophobic bowels of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, it crippled the aircraft carrier, sickened hundreds of its 4,800 sailors and  ultimately ended the tenure  of the Navy secretary. But the  ship\u2019s odyssey  is far from over \u2014 and the military\u2019s biggest covid-19 crisis could yield an epidemiological gold mine as researchers worldwide race to answer questions about the virus. At least 777 Roosevelt sailors have been infected, and the rate of asymptomatic infection is about 50 percent, the Navy said Wednesday. In contrast, the general population rate is about half that \u2014 as high as 25 percent, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. Now, as experts and governors struggle to understand the role of asymptomatic transmission to hone guidance and economic recovery options, the ship infections could reveal clues about how the virus percolates through communities, according to epidemiologists.

MADRID \u2014 The staggering toll of people lost in Spain to the coronavirus may be even more severe than originally thought, as the federal and Madrid regional governments began reporting conflicting figures Thursday. According to the Spanish Health Ministry, 7,684 people have died in Madrid, the capital, but the regional government maintains the toll is actually 12,056 because the federal number does not include those who died outside hospitals. France wrestled with a similar discrepancy in its figures, initially reporting only those who died in hospitals as confirmed covid-19 cases until officials started including deaths in nursing homes as well, starting April 1. Fernando Simon, who heads Spain\u2019s emergency health response, said Madrid\u2019s numbers were difficult to interpret and expressed doubt that all the additional deaths could be ascribed to covid-19 and not other issues, including \u201cdelays in access to hospitals\u201d caused by the pandemic. \u201cObviously there is a rise in mortality, but how we interpret that increase in the figures is important,\u201d Simon said at a daily news briefing. He announced that the total number of confirmed cases rose by 4,635 infections since the day before, to a total of 213,024, with 440 new fatalities for a national toll of 22,157.

As many as half of those who have died of covid-19 in Europe were residents of long-term care facilities, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional European office announced Thursday. \u201cThis is an unimaginable human tragedy,\u201d Hans Kluge, the WHO\u2019s regional European director, said in a  Thursday briefing , citing the latest estimates of deaths in long-term care centers. \u201cThis pandemic has shone a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued corners of our society,\u201d he said. \u201cAcross the European region, long-term care has often been notoriously neglected. But it should not be this way.\u201d As the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Europe and overwhelmed hospitals and health systems across the continent, authorities initially reacted by imposing lockdowns and seeking to curb the further spread of infection. At the beginning of the pandemic, a number of European countries, taking full stock of medical evidence that elderly patients were more vulnerable to contracting fatal cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, included long-term care facilities in those restrictions. In early March, more than a week before France went on full lockdown, President Emmanuel Macron urged citizens not to visit elderly relatives in care centers. A number of German federal states issued similar advisories. But Kluge said Thursday that \u201cthe way that such care facilities operate, how residents receive care\u201d was still \u201cproviding pathways for the virus to spread.\u201d  Kluge added that the way long-term care facilities operate would have to change in the post-pandemic world. He said tentative goals would include \u201ccomprehensive plans to prevent and control infections,\u201d an attempt to \u201cprioritize testing\u201d among facility staff and residents and providing personal protective equipment and essential medical supplies to care homes. European governments were initially slow to include data on deaths from assisted-living centers in government-issued tallies. The French Health Ministry, for instance, began daily coronavirus news briefings in mid-March but started including statistics from assisted-living centers only in early April. A month ago, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston was in trouble. Its Italian supplier of swabs for  coronavirus  tests had been forced to halt shipments. The hospital was unable to reach a deal with another supplier, Puritan Medical Products in Maine, that was struggling with surging demand. Doctors had barely a week\u2019s worth of the crucial swabs left. So Ramy Arnaout, a 43-year-old pathologist, put out calls for help. Among others, he contacted old classmates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Twenty-two frantic days later, the first of four prototypes were clinically validated. Now, hundreds of thousands of these swabs \u2014 called nasopharyngeal swabs because they reach deep into nasal passages \u2014 are being churned out each day with the help of 3-D printers. By next week, production should be up to more than a million swabs every day, Arnaout said . Read more  here . House members are headed to the Capitol on Thursday morning, even as Washington remains under a stay-at-home order, to take votes on a pair of bills bolstering funding for a small-business loan program and creating a new panel to monitor how coronavirus relief funds are spent. The House is scheduled to begin debate at 10 a.m. and vote on both measures later in the day in an extended process during which members will be led into the chamber in blocs, entering through one door and exiting through another. As an added precaution, plans call for a midafternoon cleaning of the chamber during a break in proceedings. The bills up for consideration include a $484 billion relief package that was approved earlier this week by unanimous consent in the Senate \u2014 a process that didn\u2019t require most members to be in Washington. But because the bill has some opponents in the House, leadership has asked as many members as possible to be present for Wednesday\u2019s votes. The relief bill includes funding to replenish the small-business loan program, as well as additional funding for hospitals and testing. The House is also taking up a measure pushed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to create a House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which will be chaired by Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.). According to Pelosi, the purpose of the bipartisan panel is \u201cto ensure that the over $2 trillion that Congress has dedicated to this battle \u2014 and any additional funds Congress provides in future legislation \u2014 are spent wisely and effectively.\u201d Republican leaders have argued that role is already being played by oversight groups established in previous legislation.

LONDON \u2014 A number of European governments are poised this week to revise their polices on preventive mask-wearing, as the coronavirus pandemic continues with no real end in sight. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel recommended the use of masks last week, with all of the country\u2019s states announcing plans Wednesday to make them compulsory on public transport. In some areas, masks will also have to be worn in supermarkets. The French government has advised much the same, promising to provide masks for all citizens after May 11, when France\u2019s lockdown restrictions are due to be relaxed. President Emmanuel Macron had initially said in February that masks would do little to prevent infection. In Britain, meanwhile, media reports said the government was expected Thursday to issue new advice for masks, which are currently not compulsory. \u201cThe UK is now an international outlier in its position on the public\u2019s use of non-medical face coverings,\u201d London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted Thursday as he called for a review. \u201cThe Government should change its guidance and recommend wearing non-medical face coverings when people can\u2019t keep a safe distance from others to help stop the spread.\u201d  With Britain\u2019s death toll exceeding 18,000, there was evidence that many in Britain were confused on how best to protect themselves from the deadly infection. On Wednesday, the Google search term \u201cshould I wear a mask?\u201d spiked in Britain. The World Health Organization advises that masks need to be worn only by those with symptoms or by healthy people looking after others suspected of having covid-19. The rising confusion over masks has spanned the globe, with those in favor arguing that masks slow the spread of infection, especially from asymptomatic carriers. Others insist widespread mask-wearing could lead to further shortages of personal protective equipment in hospitals that are already under unprecedented strain. First, they were declared unnecessary. Then, suddenly, they became essential \u2014  even mandatory , in some parts of the country. So the United States\u2019 surgeon general understands why you may have been confused about masks. \u201cThe recommendation changed because the information changed,\u201d Jerome M. Adams said at a White House briefing on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want from your public health leaders.\u201d Adams acknowledged that federal officials had flip-flopped on their mask guidance, clarifying the Trump administration\u2019s current guidelines. People should, in fact, wear face coverings, but heavily requested N95 and medical masks should be saved for health-care workers who are regularly exposed to the virus. In late February, Adams echoed guidance at the time from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, telling Americans that they  did not need to wear masks  in public if they were healthy. \u201cSeriously people \u2014 STOP BUYING MASKS!\u201d, he  wrote on Twitter . \u201cThey are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching  #Coronavirus .\u201d About a month later, both the CDC and Adams reversed course. But he also cast aside the notion that he had made misleading statements. \u201cWe are humble enough to say, \u2018Look, if we don\u2019t know, we are going to change,\u2019\u201d he said at the briefing. The number of Americans who say \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d in the coronavirus outbreak has dropped significantly over the past three weeks, from 74 percent to 51 percent, but the outlook is quite different depending on political affiliation, a new poll finds. According to  the latest KFF Health Tracking Poll , majorities of Democrats (64 percent) and independents (56 percent) continue to say the worst is still ahead. But Republicans are considerably more optimistic. Twice as many Republicans now say the \u201cworst is behind us\u201d (53 percent) as those who say \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d (27 percent). According to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which sponsored the poll, the partisan divide might reflect the \u201cmixed messages\u201d from governors, President Trump and health officials. Several Republican governors were among the first to announce plans to relax orders that have shuttered \u201cnonessential\u201d businesses and kept residents at home. The poll also finds that most Americans (80 percent) say strict stay-at-home measures are worth it to protect people and limit the spread of the coronavirus. A much smaller number (19 percent) say the measures are placing unnecessary burdens on people and the economy and causing more harm than good.

When it came time for the conversation about whether Carmelo Marchese should go to the hospital, his daughter didn\u2019t tell him about her fears \u2014 that he\u2019d be taken away in an ambulance and never see his family again. She didn\u2019t mention the images on the news, of  black body bags piling up  outside hospitals, nor the images in her mind, of her father in one of those bags. During the  coronavirus  pandemic, the world has officially recorded more than 130,000 deaths, many of them happening in intensive care wards sealed off to family members in one of the most chilling aspects of the virus. But an uncounted legion has died in a far different way: never making it to hospitals, or even trying to avoid them. Some of those deaths are less lonely. Read more  here . BERLIN \u2014 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic is testing democracies to their limits, because it \u201crestricts exactly the things that make up our existential rights.\u201d Her remarks in an address to parliament acknowledged the risks associated with measures to curtail individual rights \u2014 including those pursued by her own government \u2014 which have limited freedom of movement to slow the spread of the virus. Merkel defended the measures as necessary on Thursday, warning that Germany is still at the beginning of the crisis and that the current decline in new cases represents only a \u201cpreliminary success.\u201d \u201cThe situation is deceitful,\u201d Merkel said, referring to the possibility of new outbreaks and further waves of infections. Germany reopened many businesses on Monday but stepped up other measures, such as rules on the wearing of face masks. While some regional leaders in Germany have demanded a faster return to normality, Merkel has repeatedly urged patience and a more careful approach. During her almost 30-minute address, Merkel \u2014 who is usually stoical in speeches \u2014 became emotional when she recalled how coronavirus restrictions have exacerbated loneliness and hardship in care homes across the country. Germany has reported more than 150,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 5,300 deaths. Despite the high number of cases, its per capita death rate is relatively low in comparison with other major European countries, partially due to high testing levels and sufficient ICU capacity. Ahead of a virtual meeting of European Union leaders on Thursday, Merkel also called for increasing the bloc\u2019s budget, as the continent faces a prolonged recession. Germany would pay a significant portion of any budget increase. In a reference to President Trump \u2014 who suspended payments to the World Health Organization last week \u2014 Merkel referred to the United Nations agency as an \u201cindispensable partner.\u201d One police department\u2019s plan to test out a \u201cpandemic drone\u201d that can detect fevers and coughs is provoking discomfort in a wealthy Connecticut suburb. Westport, Conn., became a coronavirus hot spot in early March, after multiple guests at what became known as  \u201cParty Zero\u201d  contracted the virus and potentially spread it to others in the greater New York City area. On Tuesday, the town  announced  plans to test new drone technology that can perform biometric reading and would also allow authorities to monitor whether people are observing social distancing. \u201cThe goal is to provide better health monitoring support for potential at-risk groups, including seniors, as well as for gathering crowds at beaches, train stations, parks and recreation areas, and shopping centers,\u201d a statement from the  Westport Police Department  said. \u201cIt will not be used in individual private yards, nor does it employ facial recognition technology.\u201d The \u201cpandemic drone\u201d can monitor people\u2019s temperatures, breathing and heart rates, and detect infectious symptoms from up to 190 feet away,  according to manufacturer  Draganfly . It can also sense people coughing or sneezing in crowds. The company  says  the technology isn\u2019t designed to single out individuals. Instead, it  identifies patterns  that could show how the coronavirus is spreading, allowing public officials to react quickly. Still, many Westport residents chafed at the police department\u2019s  announcement , calling it an invasion of privacy. Several protesters with  s igns warning of a police state  gathered Wednesday outside the department\u2019s headquarters. The ACLU of Connecticut  said in a statement  that communities \u201cshould be wary of self-interested, privacy-invading companies using COVID-19 as a chance to market their products and create future business opportunities.\u201d Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

BEIRUT \u2014 Saudi Arabia might be forced to borrow an additional $26 billion in 2020 to finance a deficit caused by the global pandemic and lower oil prices, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in a virtual news conference. The gulf kingdom also expects to draw down between $29 billion to $32 billion from its reserves, he said Wednesday night, while reassuring his listeners that the country is financially equipped to deal with the economy\u2019s slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier in April, following a showdown over oil production levels in March, Saudi Arabia signed off on a multinational pact alongside Russia and the United States to cut oil production in response to a drop in demand amid the global crisis. The world\u2019s largest crude oil exporter has registered over 12,000 coronavirus cases and has canceled group prayers \u2014 a sign of how seriously the kingdom is taking the response to the crisis as the world prepares for Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, to begin tomorrow. Jadaan said that he does not expect the crisis to impact Saudi Arabia\u2019s first-quarter revenue, but announced that the country will look at further decreasing spending, following a nearly 5 percent cut in the state\u2019s yearly budget last month. Saudi Arabia was preparing itself for a comeback this year, 18 months after the murder of Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has dominated state media, emphasizing the new push for Saudi tourism. But the coronavirus threat, as well as the cut in oil production, threatens the comeback, and stops it from meeting its 2020 goals under the crown prince\u2019s plan to reform the conservative kingdom and wean it off its dependence on oil. LONDON \u2014 Boris Johnson might be recovering from the novel coronavirus, but it could take longer for the British government\u2019s reputation. On Thursday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Sky News \u201che is fully recovering, doing what we are asking people across the country to do, he is taking the advice of the medical experts.\u201d Johnson, who was hospitalized with the covid-19 disease caused by the coronavirus, has been recovering at home and has not yet returned to work. He has credited Britain\u2019s National Health Service with saving his life, \u201cno question.\u201d Lewis expressed hope that Johnson would return soon, adding: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing him back in full swing and in full grip of the reins as prime minister of the country.\u201d But Johnson\u2019s return won\u2019t be an easy one, as tension  continues to grow , with many feeling that the official response to the pandemic was slow and lagged behind other countries \u2014 including Johnson\u2019s decision to take the country into a lockdown phase only on March 23. Critics say British officials at first downplayed the severity of the infection, citing its risk as low. Others are angry at the lack of protective equipment available to NHS workers who are risking their lives to fight a virus that has claimed at least 18,000 lives in the United Kingdom. Over the weekend, an  article  in the Sunday Times titled \u201c38 days when Britain sleepwalked into disaster,\u201d blasted Johnson\u2019s handling of the health emergency. The report led Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove to confirm that the prime minister did, in fact, miss five emergency meetings on the coronavirus that took place in January and February. Oil prices recovered Thursday, after marking heavy losses earlier in the week amid concerns over a prolonged global economic downturn, the impact of lockdowns and a lack of storage space for oil. Thursday\u2019s increase in prices was driven by hopes that oil producers will further cut production in the coming days. There were also concerns over new tensions in the Middle East after President Trump  said in a tweet on Wednesday  that he had \u201cinstructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.\u201d An escalation could disrupt oil production in the region and cut supply. Prices for the international oil benchmark Brent crude were trading above the $20 threshold again, at $21.72 by 8 a.m. Greenwich Mean time on Thursday, after dropping to  their lowest point since 1999  a day earlier. U.S. oil price futures were also up, as well, even though analysts warned the recovery  is likely to be only temporary. Brent crude had  initially held up  even as U.S. oil prices dramatically fell into negative figures earlier this week, as storage space shrank and demand remained low amid lockdowns in many U.S. states. But on Wednesday, Brent crude prices had followed suit, falling as low as  $15.98 a barrel in Asian trading , partially over concerns that an OPEC-backed deal to cut global production \u2014 an attempt to prevent prices from falling further \u2014  may not be sufficient.  The deal is set to take effect next month. A Chinese citizen journalist who posted videos from Wuhan during the coronavirus outbreak  reemerged online on Wednesday , claiming he was detained by police and forced to quarantine himself over a period of nearly two months. The disappearance of Li Zehua, who says he was ordered to hand over his devices to a friend, points to China\u2019s continued crackdown on online speech as it tries to recast its handling of the coronavirus. Authorities have sent \u201cInternet police\u201d to  forcibly question hundreds  of people and force targets to sign loyalty pledges to the government. Li, who had been working for the state-run broadcaster CCTV, abruptly quit his job in February and relocated to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, the Guardian  reported. He began documenting China\u2019s fumbled response to the virus. With a critical eye, he posted videos on a local crematorium, the Committee to Protect Journalists  said , and on the efforts of a local neighborhood committee to cover up new infections. \u201cI don\u2019t want to remain silent, or shut my eyes and ears,\u201d he said at the time, according to the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m doing this because I hope more young people can, like me, stand up.\u201d On Feb. 26, Li posted two  live-streams  describing how state security agents has been chasing him earlier that day. The videos ended with unidentified individuals entering his apartment. For months, no trace of him reemerged online \u2014 until this week, when he explained what happened next, in a  video  posted on Twitter, YouTube and Weibo: The intruders took him to a local police station, Li said, where authorities told him he was under investigation on charges of disrupting public order. Though police later declined to charge him, he was forced to quarantine \u2014 first in Wuhan, and then in his hometown \u2014 because he had visited \u201csensitive\u201d areas. Two other citizen journalists , Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, disappeared after filming scenes of the effects of the virus on Wuhan. They have not reappeared.

President Trump  signed an executive order Wednesday  restricting certain categories of immigrants from entering the United States for 60 days, a move he said aims to protect the nation from the  coronavirus  and jobs for Americans at a time of excessively high unemployment and economic uncertainty. The White House  posted the full proclamation  late Wednesday after Trump announced he had signed it just before the daily coronavirus briefing. Although Trump had said on Twitter earlier in the week that he was going to suspend all immigration during the pandemic, the order he signed was much less broad and carries several exemptions.

In a video message he said the coronavirus pandemic was far more than just a public health emergency. \u201cIt is an economic crisis. A social crisis. And a human crisis that is fast becoming a human rights crisis,\u201d he said, urging that \u201cpeople and their rights must be front and center.\u201d \u201cBy respecting human rights in this time of crisis, we will build more effective and inclusive solutions,\u201d Guterres added. #COVID19  is a public health emergency \u2014 that is fast becoming a human rights crisis. People \u2014 and their rights \u2014 must be front and centre. My new report on how human rights can and must guide  #coronavirus  response & recovery:  https://t.co/CmYirKbsci   pic.twitter.com/rssMV0MPBg Guterres was referencing the conclusions of  a new U.N. report , which calls for a proportionate response to the coronavirus outbreak to preserve rights and echoes warnings from watchdogs in recent weeks. The Europe and Central Asia director of Human Rights Watch,  Hugh Williamson , said earlier this month that \u201csome governments are using the COVID-19 crisis as a cover to grab power,\u201d for instance through emergency laws. Human Rights Watch also warned that the crisis was taking a particularly heavy toll on poor residents, prisoners forced to stay in overcrowded facilities and refugees. In a  statement  accompanying the U.N. report, Guterres warned   that \u201cwe have seen how the virus does not discriminate, but its impacts do \u2014 exposing deep weaknesses in the delivery of public services and structural inequalities that impede access to them.\u201d \u201cWe must ensure that any emergency measures \u2014 including states of emergency \u2014 are legal, proportionate, necessary and nondiscriminatory, have a specific focus and duration, and take the least intrusive approach possible to protect public health,\u201d he said. Despite attention being currently focused on more immediate concerns, Guterres also urged governments to remain committed to climate action by planning recovery efforts that \u201crespect the rights of future generations.\u201d Vice President Pence said Wednesday that the White House is optimistic the coronavirus pandemic could be \u201clargely in the past\u201d by early June. \u201cThe trend lines continue to be encouraging,\u201d Pence told  \u201cThe Journal,\u201d  a podcast produced by the Wall Street Journal and Gimlet Media. \u201cWe truly do believe as we move forward, with responsibly beginning to reopen the economy in state after state around the country, that by early June, we could be at a place where this coronavirus epidemic is largely in the past.\u201d Citing declining infection rates in large metro areas like New York, Detroit and New Orleans, Pence expressed confidence that the nation is \u201cpast the peak.\u201d While he didn\u2019t offer a timeline for fully reopening the economy, he expressed hope that both Democrats and Republicans would be able to hold their national conventions in August, and that \u201cAmericans are going to be able to enjoy a good summer.\u201d While some scientists have hypothesized that coronavirus could have a  seasonal cycle  and could diminish with warmer weather, many experts remain skeptical and caution against  making plans for summer travel.  A panel convened by the National Academies of Sciences told the White House earlier this month that the spread of the virus is  unlikely  to slow significantly with the arrival of summer. In the Wednesday interview, Pence didn\u2019t express any qualms about states beginning to reopen their economies, despite not meeting the benchmarks laid out by the task force that Pence leads. \u201cWe want to defer to the governors about what they deem to be most appropriate,\u201d he said. His remarks offered a contrast with President Trump, who on Wednesday criticized Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) for allowing businesses including gyms and hair salons to reopen this week, and said he  strongly disagreed  with the move.

ATHENS \u2014 Greece has one of Europe\u2019s oldest populations, a health-care system weakened by a decade of austerity and a long history of skirting government orders. As the novel  coronavirus  spread around the globe, there was alarm in Athens that those factors might combine into a monumental human tragedy. But to the surprise of many here, Greece so far has avoided that dire scenario, emerging instead as an example of how even a vulnerable country can contain the virus if it moves quickly and persuades people to take the threat seriously. Read more  here . Unemployment data set to be released by the Labor Department on Thursday morning is expected to further the bleak economic outlook, with Reuters  estimating  more than 4 million Americans filed for unemployment claims last week. The news agency\u2019s survey of economists also shows more than 26 million people, or about 16 percent of the United States workforce, have filed for state unemployment assistance during the past five weeks. That means the coronavirus pandemic has effectively wiped out a decade of employment gains, the longest such boom in U.S. history. This month\u2019s unemployment rate is expected to shatter previous post-World War II records, which passed 10 percent in November 1982. Economists are forecasting as many as 25 million jobs were lost in April after 701,000 disappeared in March, which was the largest decline in 11 years. Yet there may be a glimmer of hope in the data. Unemployment claims for last week, as forecast by Reuters, would mark the third straight weekly decline in jobless filings, down from 5.25 million  the previous week . Although such a figure would have been unthinkable in early March, the continued drop may show the promising effects of an unprecedented government stimulus package. Under these sweeping measures, loans for small businesses could be partially forgiven if the money was used to pay employees, though the program also  faced scrutiny  for funneling millions to publicly traded companies.  Another $484 billion in additional aid  was approved by the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, promising to breathe new life into the loan program. The House is expected to vote on Thursday. According to Reuters, economists also say some of those who lost jobs amid stay-at-home orders have found jobs at supermarkets, warehouses and other essential businesses that have remained fully operational. An additional 14 crew members aboard an Italian cruise ship currently docked in Japan have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total to 48. The new cases were found in cooks and the staff serving everyone food, officials said Thursday,  according to Reuters.  One crew member who previously tested positive is now in serious condition and has been placed on a ventilator at a hospital. The Costa Atlantica has been undergoing repairs in Nagasaki prefecture since late January, and has 623 crew members on board but no passengers. While the shipyard where the ship is docked initially said that no one had left or boarded the boat after the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the prefecture in mid-March, it has since walked back those claims, Japan\u2019s  Kyodo News Service  reported. Local immigration officials told reporters that about 90 people had disembarked between March 14 and April 15, and about 40 people boarded the ship during the same time period. Japan is already facing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with over 11,500 infections and nearly 300 deaths reported to date. Health officials hope to test everyone on board the boat, and send healthy crew members back to their home countries. Meanwhile, doctors worry that local hospitals may run out of beds if the cluster of infections grows larger. The prefecture\u2019s medical association is considering declaring a medical crisis, Japanese broadcaster  NHK  reported. BERLIN \u2014 European Union leaders are expected to convene virtually Thursday to discuss how the bloc should confront dire warnings that the coronavirus crisis is putting tens of millions of jobs at risk on the continent and could cause a prolonged recession. It could be a decisive meeting for the  \u201csurvival of the E.U., \u201d according to Germany\u2019s leading weekly, Der Spiegel. After a preliminary discussion Monday,  Reuters reported , it is unlikely that any final deal on a potential recovery fund will be announced Thursday, however. The E.U. already approved a $590 billion emergency program in early April but faced renewed criticism in recent days that its response to the pandemic has been insufficient. Some of the most virus-stricken E.U. members have struggled to fund their own emergency programs. \u201cEurozone countries should shoulder the cost of financing this crisis together, because they all stand to benefit by doing so,\u201d urged European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta  in an op-ed for Politico  on Tuesday. The continent\u2019s 19 euro-zone economies could contract by more than 10 percent this year, and so the most virus-stricken countries have argued against short-term aid programs and have pushed for a longer-term structural response, including so-called coronabonds. Demands for such bonds \u2014 which would require the  joint issuance of debt  by members of the euro zone \u2014 have so far been rejected by European countries with a relatively low debt burden in the continent\u2019s north. Among the opponents is the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, where leaders fear that the instruments would tie them to high-debt nations such as Italy and Spain and would discourage austerity. One potential compromise  could be bonds issued by the E.U. , relying on money contributed by member states \u2014 a proposal that would still mainly rely on funds from major contributors such as Germany but may carry fewer risks for those countries. To this point, President Trump and the health officials around him have declined to weigh in against the  controversial decision by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to reopen portions of his state\u2019s economy , including nail salons and tattoo parlors. But that changed Wednesday night. Trump used the early part of the briefing to welcome the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, to rebut media reports about his comments about a second wave of coronavirus infections. Except Redfield didn\u2019t exactly do that. Read more  here . A $484 billion relief package is expected to pass the House on Thursday and be signed into law by President Trump, bringing the total amount of aid approved since the start of the crisis close to $3 trillion. The bill, which was  approved by the Senate on Tuesday,  will inject an additional $310 billion into the beleaguered Paycheck Protection Program, which was intended to help companies with fewer than 500 workers meet their payroll, but was quickly overwhelmed by demand. After larger companies, including some well-known nationwide chains, were revealed to have benefited from the fund, the bipartisan outrage led Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to announce new restrictions around who can apply for loans. An additional $60 billion will be set aside for an emergency grant and loan program for small businesses. As a concession to Democrats, the measure also includes an additional infusion of funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing. The $25 billion allocated for testing will be split up among states and federal agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and others, while an additional $75 billion will be directed to hospitals. Absent from the aid deals is any additional funding for cities and states that are facing massive budget deficits and may soon begin laying off government workers. Democrats hope that need will be addressed in future relief packages. Trump has indicated that he is open to the idea, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has argued that states should  consider declaring bankruptcy  instead.

RICHMOND \u2014 The Virginia General Assembly froze much of its ambitious two-year spending plan Wednesday, taking up recommendations from Gov. Ralph Northam to delay new programs until the state better understands the cost and impact of the coronavirus crisis. Meeting under extraordinary circumstances to help 140 lawmakers avoid infecting one another, the House of Delegates and Senate voted to delay increasing the state\u2019s minimum wage and approved Northam\u2019s plan to divert nearly $3 billion to cover costs associated with the deadly pandemic. Most of that money had been earmarked for the state\u2019s rainy-day reserve. Read more  here . Ryan Wittmann was wrapping up his first full week of working from home when he noticed an instant message from his boss: \u201cI think I\u2019ve got a project for you.\u201d  It was Friday, March 27, in Lincoln, Neb., and Wittmann and hundreds of his colleagues were getting the hang of running Union Bank & Trust from their makeshift home offices. Wittmann was working at a card table in his basement. Others had commandeered space in their kitchens and laundry rooms. Their jobs were about to get harder. Congress and the Trump administration had just  enacted legislation  creating a $349 billion Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses battered by the coronavirus. And they were counting on banks to get the money flowing, fast. Read more  here . At the height of Fox News\u2019s coverage of a would-be treatment for the novel coronavirus, there was a near-campaign for hydroxychloroquine by the network and Fox Business. Echoing President Trump\u2019s description of hydroxychloroquine as a \u201cgame changer,\u201d Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs and \u201cFox and Friends\u201d hosts spoke of its potential benefits in dozens of segments from mid-March to mid-April. They also criticized those in the media and the medical establishment who raised concerns, turning a debate among researchers and scientists into another front in the culture wars. But in the past week or so, Trump has all but stopped talking about hydroxychloroquine. And so have Fox News\u2019s hosts. Read more  here . There are growing concerns that any economic recovery later this year could prove short-lived because of a possible deadly resurgence of the novel  coronavirus  and a late spike in bankruptcies and defaults, a wicked combination that could cause households and businesses that barely survived the spring lockdown to go under later in the year. White House officials have touted the possibility of a V-shaped recovery as soon as this summer, pining for a swift rebound once businesses reopen on a staggered basis. But some economists say a W-shaped recovery is increasingly likely, in part because creating a vaccine is likely to take at least a year and millions of Americans and businesses are piling up debt without an easy ability to repay it.

    "title": "Nursing homes linked to up to half of coronavirus deaths in Europe, WHO says - The Washington Post",
    "text": "The Washington Post is providing this important information about the coronavirus for free.   For more free coverage of the coronavirus pandemic,  sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter  where all stories are free to read. Brussels \u2014 Up to half of coronavirus-related deaths in Europe are occurring in long-term-care facilities such as nursing homes, the World Health Organization said Thursday, an assessment that suggests public health authorities may have allowed the pandemic to rage among some of their most vulnerable populations as they focused on hospitals and other aspects of their response. A \u201cdeeply concerning picture\u201d is emerging about residents of homes for the elderly, Hans Kluge, the WHO\u2019s top official for Europe,  told reporters \u00a0at a news conference Thursday. According to countries\u2019 estimates, he said, \u201cup to half of those who have died from covid-19 were resident in long-term-care facilities. This is an unimaginable human tragedy.\u201d Kluge\u2019s warning was focused on Europe, but the United States also has struggled with the pandemic inside homes for the elderly. A  Washington Post analysis  this week found that nearly 1 in 10 nursing homes in the United States have reported cases of the novel coronavirus, with a death count that has reached the thousands. Many European countries have banned family visits to nursing homes, an attempt to shelter the residents from the spread of the virus, since it is far more lethal among older people and those with preexisting conditions. But those bans, though well-intentioned, may have deprived the elderly of advocates as conditions swiftly deteriorated. \u201cThis pandemic has shone a spotlight on the overlooked and undervalued corners of our society,\u201d Kluge said. He and other WHO officials who spoke Thursday\u00a0said they did not have enough data to say conclusively that people in nursing homes were being transferred to hospitals less often than they should be, or that they were being discharged from hospitals prematurely \u2014 fears raised by advocates in Britain and elsewhere. But the WHO officials hinted strongly that those factors might be contributing to the high death rates. \u201cIt is important that the decisions, the very tough decisions that have to be made, are not based on a single criteria like age,\u201d said Manfred Huber, a WHO specialist in long-term care. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access. Measuring and comparing  coronavirus  death rates can be difficult, because some nations are testing more suspected coronavirus cases than others are, and each country is using a different accounting method as it records cases and deaths. Many countries in Europe have essentially ignored coronavirus testing in nursing homes to focus their testing capacity on hospital patients and hospital staffers. In Italy, for instance, a recent national health service report indicated that people dying in nursing homes were overwhelmingly unlikely to have been tested for the virus. Many countries have not been carefully tracking deaths outside of hospitals, either. \u201cThe challenge is we don\u2019t have very good information for people in care homes,\u201d said Adelina \u00adComas-Herrera, a researcher at the London School of Economics. Comas-Herrera and colleagues reported last week that covid-19 deaths in nursing facilities in Belgium, Canada, France, Ireland and Norway might account for half of all coronavirus deaths in those countries. She noted that most care homes for the elderly were never designed to serve as acute care hospitals. Many do not even have a nurse on duty. A first grim glimpse of Europe\u2019s nursing home situation came on March 23, when soldiers sent to disinfect nursing homes in Madrid discovered dozens of elderly residents dead in their beds. Spain\u2019s defense minister pledged that the government would be \u201cunrelenting and forceful\u201d in finding those responsible. As of this week, public prosecutors are investigating some 86 nursing homes throughout Spain for hundreds of deaths. That probe includes 40 facilities in the Madrid region, which has outpaced the rest of the country in deaths. Spain has not included deaths in nursing homes in its official counts, although authorities say that 10 to 20\u00a0percent of residents might be infected. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Wednesday told Parliament that nursing home residents might represent 20\u00a0percent of all deaths in Britain. That corresponds to an estimate by the nonprofit National Care Forum, which says the elderly and people with disabilities in residential and nursing homes account for 4,000 of Britain\u2019s  coronavirus-related deaths. But some researchers in Britain have put the number as high as 40\u00a0percent for deaths in care homes \u2014 a staggering number, considering that such facilities house less than 1\u00a0percent of the country\u2019s population. In Belgium, where officials have included suspected cases in their overall death count since early this month, more than half of the 6,450 recorded deaths were in long-term-care facilities, not hospitals. And of those nursing home deaths, 95\u00a0percent are \u201csuspected\u201d coronavirus cases, meaning that patients displayed some of the symptoms of covid-19 but were not tested for the virus.\u00a0 \u201cWe have not had enough testing capacity in the past to confirm all of them in the laboratory,\u201d said Steven van Gucht, the head of viral diseases at Belgium\u2019s public health institute, at a news conference this week. \u201cBut that does not mean that those cases are less real.\u201d Kluge and others say that now is the time to pour resources into group homes for the elderly \u2014 to provide more testing of staffers and residents, to supply caregivers with proper protective gowns and visors, and to give them quick training to protect themselves and residents. Some employees have complained that they have been offered little or no equipment. Many facilities are staffed by people with scant medical training or none at all. Despite the vulnerability of most residents of the facilities, Kluge said, good medical care ought to be able to prevent many deaths. \u201cEven among very old people who are frail and live with multiple chronic conditions, many have a good chance of recovery if they are well cared for,\u201d he said. Italian authorities have said some of the worst outbreaks at nursing homes might have been preventable, and they have launched investigations into malpractice at a number of facilities, including one of the largest in the country: the 1,000-bed Pio Albergo Trivulzio in Milan. Italy\u2019s ANSA news service reported that 200 elderly residents had died at that facility. In France, one of the earliest coronavirus restrictions was an urging by President Emmanuel Macron that people stop visiting elderly relatives in assisted-living centers. But there\u2019s been concern about the psychological toll of that decision. Nursing home resident Jeanne Pault, 96, lamented in a televised interview this week that she hasn\u2019t been able to eat properly and that she said she is no longer able to converse with her neighbor, much less her family. \u201cIs this a life, at age 96?\u201d Pault said.

    "title": "Iran coronavirus revolutionary guard - The Washington Post",
    "text": "Last week, a powerful Iranian general went on state-run television to make an extraordinary claim: His elite military unit, the Revolutionary Guard Corps, possessed a machine that could detect the  coronavirus  from 100 meters away. Gen. Hossein Salami displayed the \u201cMustaan,\u201d a handheld gizmo resembling a small satellite dish, and said its 80\u00a0percent success rate would help end the country\u2019s coronavirus ordeal. He called it \u201can astonishing scientific phenomenon.\u201d Iranian public health officials downplayed the claim, which was widely ridiculed on social media. Yet Salami\u2019s TV pitch was merely a more theatrical rendering of a message that Iran\u2019s hard-line rulers have been seeking to deliver in recent weeks. The country\u2019s elite security force is aggressively promoting itself as Iran\u2019s true guardian during the pandemic, a provider of medical treatment, clinics, relief aid and \u2014 occasionally \u2014 even dubious \u201ccures\u201d and fixes. Iran has been among the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus, with an  official death toll  of more than 5,000, a figure that many outside experts think vastly understates the virus\u2019s true impact. But while the outbreak continues to ravage the country and its economy, the Revolutionary Guard and its allies are seizing opportunities amid the crisis to expand their already powerful base while also cracking down on public displays of discontent, Western intelligence officials and Iran analysts said. The moves to consolidate power follow a string of recent crises \u2014  including the downing of a Ukrainian civilian airliner  \u2014 that challenged the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s reputation both at home and abroad, and had appeared to put the force on the back foot. But now, with the explicit support of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the army, Revolutionary Guard and its paramilitary Basij force have taken command of the country\u2019s response to the pandemic, including the construction of hospitals and the enforcement of quarantine laws. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access. U.S. and European officials say that the security branches\u2019 bid for greater dominance during the crisis appears intended, in part, to discredit President Hassan Rouhani, whose more moderate government has been faulted by conservative leaders for a bungled early response to the pandemic. The Revolutionary Guard\u2019s new role could leave Iran more firmly in the hands of virulently anti-Western elements who favor a more confrontational stance toward its adversaries, including the United States and Israel, U.S. and European analysts say. \u201cCovid-19 has accelerated a trend that began long ago, which is Iran\u2019s transition from clerical autocracy to military autocracy,\u201d said Karim Sadjadpour, a Middle East expert and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank. \u201cNobody is saying \u2018no\u2019 to the Revolutionary Guard these days,\u201d Sadjadpour said. Documents provide rare glimpse into Iran\u2019s struggles with Covid-19 The Revolutionary Guard\u2019s power play comes at a time when the elite force is itself facing extreme financial and other pressures. The Revolutionary Guard\u2019s most prominent commander, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in January, and its ranks have been hit especially hard by the virus, which has sickened or killed numerous leaders and soldiers. But the economic damage from the outbreak has delivered a far greater blow, according to U.S. and European intelligence officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified assessments. Iran\u2019s economy, already battered by U.S. sanctions, is now reeling from the virus\u2019s fallout. Last month, officials requested a $5\u00a0billion emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund to help offset the impact, prompting an immediate threat by the Trump administration to use its leverage at the IMF to block the request. Iran\u2019s economic affairs and finance minister said that the outbreak could cost the country as much as 15\u00a0percent of its gross domestic product. Many of the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s financial enterprises \u2014 including in Iran\u2019s construction, automotive and oil and gas industries \u2014 have also taken direct hits, and a sudden cash shortage is beginning to fray relations with the group\u2019s alliance of pro-Iranian militias from Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. The Revolutionary Guard derives much of its income from oil, most of it smuggled and sold on the black market in defiance of international sanctions. Iran\u2019s economy already was in free fall due in part to mismanagement and falling oil prices, as well as U.S. trade restrictions. In October, the IMF predicted the Iranian economy would shrink by more than 9\u00a0percent this year. The global spread of the virus accelerated the decline by triggering  a crash in oil markets  worldwide. As a result, the Revolutionary Guard and its foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, have been forced to curtail or freeze some of their activities, including in Syria, where Iran-backed militias are helping President Bashar al-Assad reclaim the last rebel strongholds in that country\u2019s civil war. Social media postings in recent weeks have depicted fighters being redeployed to factories to sew surgical masks and gowns. Revolutionary Guard leaders have even turned to its militia clients to ask for financial help, U.S. and European officials said. At least some of the militias appear to be chafing under the new conditions. \u201cThey don\u2019t have as much cash to give away,\u201d said a European intelligence official. Militias in Lebanon and other countries have been asked to \u201cdo fundraisers and funnel money back to the Iranian security service structure,\u201d the official said. Now joining the covid-19 fight: armed groups, cartels, gangs With oil profits drying up, the group\u2019s leaders are scrambling to find new sources of revenue, U.S. and European officials and analysts said. \u201cThey have increased their efforts in smuggling and other criminal [activities] to make money,\u201d said a Europe-based Iran analyst, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive assessments. \u201cIran was under a lot of stress due to the sanctions. Now oil prices as well as covid-19 are hitting them very hard.\u201d How U.S. officials hindered Iran\u2019s access to medical gear for pandemic At home, the pandemic has created new opportunities. Inside Iran, the Revolutionary Guard commands the Basij force, a 90,000-strong volunteer paramilitary group that Revolutionary Guard leaders have used as muscle to enforce quarantines as well as build treatment centers. The volunteers have traditionally been deployed as shock troops to quash protests in times of unrest. In recent weeks, the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s media wing has promoted images of soldiers and Basij members performing tasks such as screening patients, disinfecting public spaces and setting up temporary hospitals. Last month, officials in Tehran approved a substantial increase in defense and law enforcement spending, including funds earmarked both for the Revolutionary Guard and Basij volunteers. \u201cIt is possible that some of [the] increased spending will be directed toward countering the pandemic, such as through funding the construction of temporary medical centers,\u201d said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at Eurasia Group. \u201cBut the budget decision, combined with the recent attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq, sends a powerful signal to the U.S. and others that Iran will not back away from domestic repression or foreign intervention despite the severe public health crisis,\u201d he said. Last week, Khamenei assigned the Revolutionary Guard yet another responsibility: disbursing aid to millions of needy Iranians. Salami formally launched the \u201cImam Hassan\u201d center at a ceremony last Tuesday, saying the Revolutionary Guard and Basij forces would distribute aid packages to 3.5 million citizens. \u201cOur rising capabilities are showing brilliance and amazing distinction compared to the developed countries,\u201d the state-run Mehr News Agency quoted Salami as saying. Pandemic is undercutting Trump\u2019s \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 campaign Salami unveiled the Mustaan virus-detection device at a separate event with mask-wearing Basij leaders the following day. A Basij spokesman said the device was invented by the Basij and was designed to spot the coronavirus anywhere within a 100-meter radius in as little as five seconds. After the demonstration, Iran\u2019s government-run Ministry of Health and Medical Education released a statement noting the Mustaan had not been officially tested or approved. Saeid Golkar, a University of Tennessee at Chattanooga assistant professor and expert on Iran\u2019s elite security forces, said such events show that the Revolutionary Guard perceives the crisis as a serious threat in need of magical fixes. \u201cThe possibility of political instability in Iran is increasing rapidly,\u201d said Golkar, author of  a 2015 book on the Basij . \u201cThey realize that they need to find ways to gain support, especially among the poor and lower classes, the people who have mostly likely lost their jobs.\u201d Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

    "title": "Coronavirus UK map: How many confirmed cases are there in your area? - BBC News",
    "text": "The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK has reached more than 138,000 and at least 18,738 people confirmed to have had the virus have died.  The actual number of cases is estimated to be much higher though - as it is mostly those in hospital and some NHS and care home staff who are currently being tested.  More than 425,000 people have been tested for coronavirus so far. The following charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are responding. Find out how many people have confirmed cases in your area:  \n                        A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.\n                     Enter a full postcode to find out. Note: Confirmed cases only include those testing positive for the virus, not all will have been tested. Deaths in England only include those in hospitals, those outside England may include a small number that occured in the community. If you can't see the look-up click here. Northern Ireland cases by council area have not been made available since 20 April. The BBC's head of statistics Robert Cuffe says that today's figure of 616 deaths - down from 823 yesterday - shows how the decline from the peak is likely to be gradual and bumpy.  The peaks and troughs are exacerbated by reporting lags, especially at weekends, he adds. The picture of decline is further supported by NHS England's analysis of deaths on the day they actually occur - this shows a smooth rise to a peak in the week before Easter and a smoother, gradual decline since then. Despite this tailing off the UK is still approaching 20,000 deaths - a toll that only the US, Spain, Italy and France have passed. The most recent figures will be revised upwards as recent deaths are reported, but statisticians are increasingly confident that those late-reported deaths are unlikely to return us to levels seen before Easter. Recent data also suggests that deaths in London are declining now at a faster rate than in other regions of England. Overall, the majority of the deaths have been in England, with 16,786 deaths in hospitals so far.  London and the Midlands have seen the highest tolls, but the numbers in other regions have been going up more quickly in recent days.  In Scotland, 1,120 people have died so far, while the figure in Wales is 641. Northern Ireland has seen 263 deaths in total. Most deaths have been among the elderly. Figures released by NHS England show more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80.  And fewer than one in 10 of those who have died have been under the age of 60. There also appears to be a \"disproportionate impact\" on those from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, according to Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick. Research needs to be done \"swiftly\" to \"better understand it\", he said. The UK's overall death figure is almost entirely made up from those people who died in hospital and tested positive for the virus.  For the most part, it does not include deaths in the community, for example in care homes, or people who have died in their own homes.  On Tuesday the Office for National Statistics said there had been some 18,500 deaths in the week up to 10 April - about  8,000 more than is normal at this time of year . Thursday's figure of 4,583 new cases is slightly higher than the previous day.  But it is still down on the 5,850 recorded on Sunday, which was the second highest daily increase in new infections, possibly as a result of more testing being carried out.   The highest daily total was on 5 April, when more than 6,000 new cases were confirmed.  The coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease  known as Covid-19 , was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January. While a number of people tested positive throughout February, infections in the UK began to rise substantially towards the end of March.  As with deaths, cases were heavily concentrated in London, the Midlands and the North West, but South Wales and parts of Scotland also have higher concentrations of cases. Currently, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the UK remains lower than some other European countries.  For example, in Italy there have been more than 189,000 confirmed cases and more than 25,000 deaths. Lockdown restrictions have been partially lifted in some other European countries, including Italy and Austria, as the increase in the number of deaths each day has slowed.  The UK government says the measures are working, but  five conditions  must be met before the lockdown is eased.  On Wednesday the government's chief medical advisor Chris Whitty said the UK would have to live with some disruptive social measures for at least the rest of the year.  He said it was \"wholly unrealistic\" to expect life to return to normal until there was a \"highly effective vaccine\" or drugs to treat the disease.  On Thursday Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that employers of essential workers will now be able to book a coronavirus test for their staff online, while key workers can request a test for themselves online from Friday.  Some 18,000 people will also be hired to help trace coronavirus infections, the health secretary said. Thursday's figures showed that just over 23,000 coronavirus tests were carried out in the preceding 24 hours, up slightly from Wednesday's number. In total, more than 425,000 people have now been tested. Mr Hancock previously  set a target  of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April - and  on Wednesday the government insisted that that figure would be met.  Most of the tests so far have been reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. But earlier this month the government began to publish figures which included key workers and their households, as well as hospital patients.  Previously, the testing of key workers and their families had not been included in the daily figures.  Increasing the number of people being tested for coronavirus will play a key part in analysing its spread in the UK.  The number of people in hospital with coronavirus dropped again on Thursday to 16,906, down from 17,477 the day before. Professor Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, said on Wednesday that the situation around the country was either improving or broadly flat.  The government has said making sure the NHS can cope with a second peak of the virus is one of the five conditions that must be met. Another of the conditions is ensuring that the supply of tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) can meet future demand.",

    "title": "Coronavirus: First patients injected in UK vaccine trial - BBC News",
    "text": "The first human trial in Europe of a coronavirus vaccine has begun in Oxford. Two volunteers were injected, the first of more than 800 people recruited for the study. Half will receive the Covid-19 vaccine, and half a control vaccine which protects against meningitis but not coronavirus.   The design of the trial means volunteers will not know which vaccine they are getting, though doctors will.   Elisa Granato, one of the two who received the jab, told the BBC: \"I'm a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.\" The vaccine was developed in under three months by a team at Oxford University. Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, led the pre-clinical research. \"Personally I have a high degree of confidence in this vaccine,\" she said. \"Of course, we have to test it and get data from humans. We have to demonstrate it actually works and stops people getting infected with coronavirus before using the vaccine in the wider population.\" Prof Gilbert previously said she was \"80% confident\" the vaccine would work, but now prefers not to put a figure on it, saying simply she is \"very optimistic\" about its chances. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees that has been modified so it cannot grow in humans. The Oxford team has already developed a vaccine against Mers, another type of coronavirus, using the same approach - and that had promising results in clinical trials.    The only way the team will know if the Covid-19 vaccine works is by comparing the number of people who get infected with coronavirus in the months ahead from the two arms of the trial.   That could be a problem if cases fall rapidly in the UK, because there may not be enough data.  Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who is leading the trial, said: \"We're chasing the end of this current epidemic wave.  If we don't catch that, we won't be able to tell whether the vaccine works in the next few months. But we do expect that there will be more cases in the future because this virus hasn't gone away.\" The vaccine researchers are prioritising the recruitment of local healthcare workers into the trial as they are more likely than others to be exposed to the virus. A larger trial, of about 5,000 volunteers, will start in the coming months and will have no age limit.   Older people tend to have weaker immune responses to vaccines. Researchers are evaluating whether they might need two doses of the jab.  The Oxford team is also considering a vaccine trial in Africa, possibly in Kenya, where the rates of transmission are growing from a lower base. If the numbers could be a problem, why not deliberately infect volunteers with coronavirus? That would be a quick and certain way to find out if the vaccine was effective, but it would be ethically questionable because there are no proven treatments for Covid-19. But that might be possible in the future. Prof Pollard said: \"If we reach the point where we had some treatments for the disease and we could guarantee the safety of volunteers, that would be a very good way of testing a vaccine.\" The trial volunteers will be carefully monitored in the coming months. They have been told that some may get a sore arm, headaches or fevers in the first couple of days after vaccination. They are also told there is a theoretical risk that the virus could induce a serious reaction to coronavirus, which arose in some early Sars animal vaccine studies.   But the Oxford team says its data suggests the risk of the vaccine producing an enhanced disease is minimal.   Scientists there hope to have one million doses ready by September, and to dramatically scale up manufacturing after that, should the vaccine prove effective.   Prof Gilbert says that has not been decided yet: \"It's not really our role to dictate what will happen, we just have to try to get a vaccine that works and have enough of it and then it will be for others to decide.\" Prof Pollard added: \"We've got to ensure we have enough doses to provide for those in greatest need, not just in the UK but also in developing countries.\" Another team at Imperial College London hopes to begin human trials of its coronavirus vaccine in June.   The Oxford and Imperial teams have received more than \u00a340m of government funding. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has praised both teams and said the UK will \"throw everything we've got\" at developing a vaccine. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has said neither a vaccine, nor a drug to treat Covid-19, is likely to be available within the next year.",

    "title": "Meet the ICU nurse who silently stood in protest at rally to reopen Arizona - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) On her day off from working at a Covid-19 unit in an Arizona hospital, ICU nurse Lauren Leander threw on a pair of clean scrubs and headed to an anti-lockdown protest at the state Capitol.  She was determined to be a voice for her patients through silence. Leander, a Banner Health nurse of five years, joined an intimate group of healthcare workers on Monday to counter protest at the Capitol, where people gathered to urge the governor to reopen the state. Standing up straight, her arms crossed and face mask on, Leander stood on the Capitol steps, with a handful of healthcare workers lined up by her side. She said she only spoke if someone encroached on her personal space, despite people raising their voices at her. \"It was heated, people were very fired up about what they had to say,\" she said. \"A lot of the top comments we got were about us being fake nurses, there was a huge majority of them that still believe this virus is fake, that it's a hoax and not real at all. They were convinced that we're fake nurses and that's why we weren't talking.\"  Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has put a  stay-at-home order  in place until April 30. Because of this, several different groups of rallied at the Capitol to say the economy has suffered enough and the order needs to be lifted, according to CNN affiliate  KNXV . Leander told CNN she volunteered to work in the hospital's Covid-19 unit full time and has been seeing patients from all over the state for the last month. \"I just hope people see that nurses are not the enemy and we'll take care of them one way or the other,\" Leander said. \"I don't care if you believe in this virus or not or truly what your opinion is of it, if these people show up in my ICU we will take care of them one way or another.\" The power of silence After seeing photos and video Sunday of people at a  rally in Denver,  Colorado, demanding the state reopen and ease restrictions designed to slow the spread of coronavirus, Leander said she was inspired and wanted to stand up in support of her fellow healthcare workers.  After seeing a Facebook post about Monday's rally, Leander said she texted a few of her colleagues and headed there. Leander and the few other nurses, from other hospitals, stood in silence at the \"Patriots' Day Rally\" at the Capitol where nearly 1,000 people gathered, according to KNXV.   \"This isn't about politics, choosing sides, this virus does not discriminate at all,\" she said. \"It's taking lives from one end of the spectrum to another. I know it's wishful thinking but I just would love if we just had that common ground with fighting this virus.\" Leander said right now the public needs to be listening to the experts who are studying this virus. Even as nurses, they're relying on science to guide them.  \"Our main message was that we wanted healthcare workers' voices to be heard louder than misinformation and fear,\" Leander said. \"There will be a calm and controlled manner to reopen our economy and our state...you don't open the flood gates and release everyone at once.\"  Experiencing heartbreaking moments at work Photos from the rally in Denver caught the attention of many on social media, including former Arizona state Sen. Dr. Kelli Ward, who challenged Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary in 2016. Ward tweeted Tuesday morning, questioning the authenticity of the healthcare workers who attended and calling the movement propaganda. \"EVEN IF these 'spontaneously' appearing ppl at protests against govt overreach (sporting the same outfits, postures, & facial expressions) ARE involved in healthcare - when they appeared at rallies, they were actors playing parts #Propaganda #FakeOutrage,\"  Ward tweeted . CNN has reached out to Ward for comment. After hearing about Ward's tweet, Leander said if given the opportunity she would walk her through the ICU at her hospital to the bedside of some of her coronavirus patients to see firsthand the impacts of the virus.  \"I wish she could be in my shoes for a day, I'd have her put on a pair of scrubs and walk with me,\" Leander said.  Leander has not seen any of her family members since she's been working in the Covid-19 unit. And although that lost time has been tough, what she's been experiencing in the hospital is tougher.  \"A human being having to pass away via FaceTime because their family is not allowed in the hospital during this crisis, it's the most heartbreaking thing you will ever see,\" she said. A few days ago, Leander said she had a patient grab her hand and say, \"Please tell me I'm not going to die here.\" While Leander knows better days are ahead, she said it doesn't take away from the reality that there are people impacted and suffering right now.",

    "title": "Fact check: Trump wrongly suggests sunlight could help cure coronavirus - CNNPolitics",
    "text": "Washington  (CNN) On Thursday, President Donald Trump added to his  list of dubious or inaccurate coronavirus-related medical claims , wrongly suggesting at a White House briefing that sunlight could possibly be used to treat people who have the virus. Trump also issued a false denial when asked why he has stopped promoting the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment, incorrectly saying, \"I haven't at all.\" He referred to how \"we started with a broken test\" without explaining that the faulty initial test was created during his presidency, this year. And Trump said that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden does not want to debate because of the coronavirus, though Biden has consistently expressed an eagerness to debate Trump even if it cannot be in person. Sunlight as treatment After Bill Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, explained during the briefing that new experiments show the coronavirus does not fare well under sunlight or heat, the President suggested that Americans who have the virus could treat it by going out into the sunlight on a hot day.  \"There's been a rumor that -- you know, a very nice rumor -- that you go outside in the sun or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses,\" Trump said, before asking coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx \"to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know, if you could.\" Trump then asked Birx if she \"ever heard of the heat and the light\" having an impact on viruses. She responded, \"Not as a treatment,\" before Trump asked her again to look into it.  Later, Trump again directed Birx to look into the potential for sunlight to be a cure.  \"I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know, if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can't.\" Facts First:   As Birx told Trump directly, and as medical experts said after the briefing, sunlight isn't a potential treatment for coronavirus. This bizarre exchange is the latest example of Trump grasping for a quick fix for the pandemic, after he previously suggested it might \"go away\" in warm weather and that anti-malaria pills could be a \"game-changer.\"  Immediately after the briefing, two doctors told CNN's Erin Burnett that Trump's comments did not make medical sense and warned against taking his suggestions seriously.  \"Very little of what the President said as it pertains to disinfection or phototherapy makes any sense,\" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist at The George Washington University Hospital who advised the White House during President George W. Bush's tenure. \"Look, everyone wants a quick fix. And the President clearly wants a quick fix; we all do. But there are no quick fixes. We have to do this the right way; we have to do this with science.\"  Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician who works at Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University, also batted down the President's suggestion and warned that trying it could cause sunburn, skin cancer or other dangerous consequences.  \"Going out in the sun or exposing yourself to these high-intensity UV lamps is not going to protect you from Covid-19,\" she said on CNN. \"I don't want people to think that this is another miracle cure.\" False denial on hydroxychloroquine  At Thursday's briefing, Trump issued a false denial when asked why he has stopped his promotion of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that he embraces as a potential cure for coronavirus. \"I haven't at all,\" the President said, before asking the reporter, \"Why do you say I have?\" Facts First:   Trump has significantly tamped down his rhetoric about the drug in the past week, compared with his comments in March, according to a  CNN analysis .  In March and early April, the President name-dropped hydroxychloroquine almost daily, and he mentioned it dozens of times at White House briefings, according to the CNN tally. He  incorrectly implied  it was safe to treat Covid-19, encouraged Americans to \"try it\" and said it might be the biggest breakthrough in modern medicine.  \"What do you have to lose?\" he asked during a briefing in April. But he hasn't mentioned the drug by name -- or touted its effectiveness -- in more than a week. Trump stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine around the time that a  series of studies  came back with negative results. New research from Brazil, France and veterans' hospitals in the US indicate that the drug might not help patients with the coronavirus, and might even have deadly side effects. For the second day in a row, the President also said he didn't see the study of US veterans' hospitals, even though he was asked about it both days and it has been  covered heavily  in the mainstream media.  About the research into the drug, Trump said, \"We had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren't so good.\" It's true that there were some studies earlier this year with promising results for Covid-19. But public health experts said that much of that research was  anecdotal , and the publisher of a study that Trump repeatedly cited now says there were  serious flaws with the trial . Joe Biden and debates  Trump claimed that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is \"a guy who doesn't want to do debates because of Covid.\"  Facts First:   This is misleading. In late March, two weeks before Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary, Biden said he was focused on the pandemic crisis and  did not think there should be another debate  against Sanders, over whom he had an overwhelming delegate lead. But Biden has never said he does not want to debate Trump in particular, because of the virus or for any other reason. Rather, Biden has consistently expressed eagerness to debate Trump even if it is not in person -- saying at a fundraiser earlier on Thursday that \"I can hardly wait to debate Donald Trump. Are you kidding?\" According to a pool report from Washington Post reporter Annie Linskey, Biden then added: \"Look, I'm ready to debate him. Zoom or Skype or Slack or Hangouts or in person, anytime, anywhere he wants.\"  Biden made a similar comment in an  interview  on March 31, Bloomberg News reported: \"I'm ready to debate President Trump on Zoom or Skype anytime he wants.\"   \"I can hardly wait to get him on a debate stage,\" Biden  said  on ABC's \"The View\" in February.  \"Come on, Mr. President. I can hardly wait,\" he  told  CNN's Anderson Cooper in early March. ",

    "title": "Maxine Waters says her sister is dying of coronavirus - CNNPolitics",
    "text": " (CNN) Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the influential House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday that her sister is dying of coronavirus in a hospital in St Louis, Missouri. \"I'm going to take a moment to dedicate this legislation to my dear sister who is dying in a hospital in St. Louis, Missouri right now, infected by the coronavirus,\" Waters said on the House floor ahead of a vote  on a package worth more than $480 billion  in Covid-19 response. While speaking, Waters lowered her face mask to be heard, one of multiple lawmakers seen wearing face masks Thursday. Waters was speaking in support of the already passed Paycheck Protection Program and the pending Health Care Enhancement Act, which is  expected to pass a House vote on Thursday . President Donald Trump has publicly supported the bill, indicating he will sign it when it reaches the Oval Office. This legislation would provide $370 billion in funding for small business loans and $100 billion for hospitals and additional coronavirus testing. Waters is a liberal Democrat who has  previously gone further than many of her Democratic colleagues in rebuking Trump . She has served in the Congress since 1991. Waters is not the only member of Congress who has personally experienced the pain of the virus. This morning, Democratic Sen.  Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts shared  that her brother passed away after testing positive for coronavirus. ",

    "title": "A seemingly healthy woman's sudden death is now the first known US coronavirus-related fatality - CNN",
    "text": " (CNN) A 57-year-old Northern California woman whose February 6 death has become the  first known coronavirus-related fatality in the US  had been in relatively good health, her brother told CNN. She was Patricia Dowd, a Bay Area woman who worked as a manager for a semiconductor company and who \"exercised routinely, watched her diet and took no medication,\" the  Los Angeles Times first reported Wednesday .   Rick Cabello, Dowd's older brother, told CNN she didn't smoke and was in good health.  \"She was an athlete in her high school days, she was always active,\" Cabello said Wednesday. Her sudden death was a shock to family members. They all believed it was a heart attack, Cabello said.   California's Santa Clara County had announced Tuesday that tissue samples confirmed two people who had died in early February tested positive for  coronavirus  -- well before the United States' previously understood first coronavirus-related death on February 29 in Washington state. One victim was a 57-year-old woman who died on February 6, and the other was a 67-year-old man who died on February 17, the county said. The county did not name the woman, but Cabello told the Los Angeles Times and CNN that she was Dowd, his sister.  Neither patient had a recent history of travel that would have exposed them to the virus, Santa Clara County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Sara Cody said in a Wednesday news conference, and officials are presuming both cases represent community transmission.   'She had flu-like symptoms'  Before Dowd was found dead February 6, \"she had flu-like symptoms for a few days, then appeared to recover,\" the Los Angeles Times reported.    Five days before she died, Dowd called her brother to tell him she couldn't make it to a family visit in Stockton, California.  \"She wasn't feeling well, which was very unusual for her,\" Cabello said. \"I remember her specifically saying 'I'm not feeling well,'\" he added.   She also had canceled plans to go a weekend funeral, the Los Angeles   Times reported. Dowd started working from home as her condition improved and had been in touch with a colleague around 8 a.m. on the day of her death. She was found dead about two hours later, according to the Los Angeles Times.  A traveler and 'everybody's rock' Dowd was a frequent world traveler, her brother said. She had planned to travel to China later this year and went abroad \"multiple times a year to different global locations,\" a family member told the   Los Angeles Times. Dowd had a history of foreign travel, as did her coworkers at Lam Research, the newspaper also reported.  Dowd was \"hardworking, loyal, and caring,\" Cabello told the Los Angeles   Times.  \"She was the energy person in her large network of friends,\" her brother said. \"She was everybody's rock.\"  In a tribute wall set up for Patricia Dowd by the Cusimano Family Colonial Mortuary, a coworker wrote, \"I'll always remember the kindness and generosity of her spirit. She was genuinely caring and had an amazing energy.\"  As more deaths are investigated, more positives may come Neither of the two victims who died in February had been tested for the virus at the time of their deaths because testing capacity was limited, Santa Clara County officials said Tuesday in a news release. Tests were only available through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were restricted to people who had a known travel history and showed certain symptoms.  Both of the victims who passed away in February had flu-like symptoms before dying, county officials said.  \"Because there was continued suspicion by the medical examiner that these deaths were caused by Covid-19, the medical examiner sent autopsy tissue to the CDC for definitive testing,\" the coroner's office said in a statement. As the county investigates more deaths, it's likely that more will be tied to the virus, officials said. And that adds to evidence that suggests the  current case and death tallies across the country may be significant undercounts. ",

Two Tennessee brothers who went viral for hoarding and then attempting to resell tens of thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer will not face prosecution or a fine, officials  said  Tuesday. Matt and Noah Colvin gained notoriety after a New York Times story profiled their efforts to stockpile the antibacterial gel and then sell bottles for as much as $70 each online. The brothers in Chattanooga had swept across stores in Tennessee and Kentucky, driving 1,300 miles to clear shelves of the alcohol-based disinfectant. After immediately selling 300 bottles on Amazon, the online retailer pulled their sales listings and thousands of other similar items, leaving them with 17,700 bottles of sanitizer. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Amid accusations of price gouging, the Colvins settled with state authorities, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III said in a news release. After receiving a cease-and-desist letter, the brothers  donated  their hand sanitizer last month to nonprofit organizations in Tennessee and Kentucky, which officials on Tuesday said was acceptable as restitution. That may have been a silver lining to their online saga. \u201cDisrupting necessary supplies during an unprecedented pandemic is a serious offense,\u201d Slatery said. \u201cIt became clear during our investigation that the Colvins realized this, and their prompt cooperation and donation led to an outcome that actually benefited some consumers.\u201d Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Los Angeles County health officials later this week will start publicly identifying restaurants that have had coronavirus outbreaks, they  said  on Wednesday. The county\u2019s website  currently lists  nursing homes, jails and prisons, homeless shelters and other \u201cinstitutional facilities\u201d that have had at least one confirmed case. Data on the site is broken down between residents and staff members and between probable and confirmed infections. It is not clear how the county, the largest in the nation, is defining an outbreak or how long it will list restaurants online. The announcement comes after workers at several fast-food locations across California  staged protests  calling for more protective equipment and greater transparency after outbreaks at some stores. At McDonald\u2019s and Domino\u2019s Pizza franchises in Los Angeles, workers  charged  that managers did not inform them that their co-workers had tested positive for the coronavirus, in some cases keeping stores open for days longer and bringing in staff from other locations. High-end restaurants in the area have reported cases, too. Earlier this month, renowned chef Nancy Silverton, best known for popularizing sourdough bread,  announced  that she had tested positive for the virus. Throughout March, as the pandemic gained momentum in the United States, much of the preparations focused on ventilators, the breathing machines that were supposed to save everyone\u2019s lives. Now five weeks into the crisis, a paper published in the  Journal of the American Medical Association  about New York\u2019s largest health system suggests a reality that, like so much else about the novel  coronavirus , confounds our early expectations. Researchers found that 20 percent of all those hospitalized died \u2014 a finding that\u2019s similar to the percentage who perish in normal times among patients admitted for respiratory distress. But the numbers diverge more for the critically ill put on ventilators: 88 percent of the 320 covid-19 patients on ventilators who were tracked in the study died. Read more  here. Texas began allowing certain elective medical procedures to continue amid the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday. Abortions will be among them, according to a  report by the Texas Tribune . This is the latest development in a winding, month-long saga for abortions in Texas, which is part of a  battle between states and abortion providers across the country . Gov. Greg Abbott (R) had banned abortions in March to direct all medical resources toward preventing and treating coronavirus infections. There was immediate pushback from abortion providers and legal action spurred by Planned Parenthood. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled in favor of Abbott\u2019s ban on April 7. Abbott\u2019s latest order will allow medical facilities to resume procedures under two conditions: They have to keep a certain number of beds open for covid-19 patients and refrain from taking personal protective equipment from public sources. Nearly one-third of governors over the past week have said they lack sufficient  coronavirus  testing supplies to reopen their states, according to a Fix analysis of public statements. The comments come after the Trump administration in recent days said  states have the testing capacity needed to start to reopen if they choose . \u201cUltimately, we\u2019re doing more testing I think than probably any of the governors even want,\u201d President Trump said Tuesday. Many of the 16 governors who have said they lack testing supplies have not disputed they have ample testing capacity to start to reopen, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other hindrances. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said his state  needs to double existing testing , while Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) said his state  needs to quintuple existing testing . Read more  here . Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman\u2019s proposal to reopen the city is \u201coutrageous,\u201d Nevada\u2019s largest union said in a statement Wednesday. The Culinary Union\u2019s statement followed an interview Goodman did earlier in the day with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in which Goodman advocated for casinos to be reopened because \u201cwe\u2019ve had viruses for years here.\u201d The union said it supports the stay-home order that\u2019s in place. Eleven members of the union have died of coronavirus complications, said Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline, the union\u2019s secretary-treasurer. \u201cWe want people back to work, but it has to be safe and secure and we don\u2019t want workers to be part of an experiment,\u201d Arg\u00fcello-Kline wrote. The union also noted that while Goodman is the mayor of Las Vegas, she doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over the Strip, the 4-mile stretch of mega-hotels and casinos that sits south of the city limits in unincorporated Clark County. Goodman began trending on Twitter shortly after the interview with Cooper. She told him it would be up to the businesses that reopen to make sure people practice social distancing and don\u2019t spread the virus \u2014 otherwise, the businesses would become unpopular. \u201cThat\u2019s up to them to figure out,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t own a casino.\u201d Cooper repeatedly questioned how opening the city during a pandemic wouldn\u2019t make it \u201ca petri dish\u201d for the novel coronavirus, which has killed 187 people and infected 4,081 in Nevada. Goodman called Cooper an alarmist. She said she had asked the city statistician whether residents could be a \u201ccontrol group\u201d for the virus but the statistician told her people commute into the city, and it wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cWe offered to be a control group,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was offered; it was turned down.\u201d Speaking on CNN later Wednesday, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) said Nevadans wouldn\u2019t be used as a control group. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Three lions and three more tigers at the Bronx Zoo have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the zoo said Wednesday, nearly three weeks after it announced a positive case in a tiger named Nadia. The zoo had suspected that the other big cats were also positive, because most of them had displayed a dry cough, Nadia\u2019s primary symptom. She was the only cat initially tested because the kind of samples that were taken \u2014 from her nose, throat and respiratory tract \u2014 required that she be anesthetized. The six additional cases were confirmed via fecal tests that did not require the animals to be sedated, the zoo said. All the cats \u201ccontinue to do well. They are behaving normally, eating well, and their coughing is greatly reduced,\u201d the zoo said in a statement. The cats were infected by a staff member who was asymptomatic, the zoo said. No other wildcats at the zoo are showing signs of illness. Nadia was the first animal in the United States to test positive for the virus, which causes the disease covid-19 in humans. On Wednesday, the Agriculture Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that two pet cats in New York had also tested positive for the virus. Outside the United States, a small number of pet dogs and cats are known to have been infected, and studies have found that cats and ferrets are particularly susceptible. But scientists emphasize that in all cases, the animals have been \u2014 or are assumed to have been \u2014 infected by humans. There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans or that they are playing a role in its spread, public health officials say. Read more  here . Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued a candid warning in  a Tuesday Washington Post interview : A simultaneous flu and coronavirus outbreak next fall and winter \u201cwill actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,\u201d adding that calls and protests to \u201cliberate\u201d states from stay-at-home orders \u2014 as President Trump has tweeted \u2014 were \u201cnot helpful.\u201d Wednesday morning, Trump said Redfield was misquoted and that Redfield would provide a statement. But when Redfield appeared at the daily White House briefing Wednesday evening, he said he had been accurately quoted after all, while also trying to soften his words as the president glowered next to him. The remarkable spectacle provided another illustration of the president\u2019s tenuous relationship with his own administration\u2019s scientific and public health experts, where the unofficial message from the Oval Office is an unmistakable warning: Those who challenge the president\u2019s erratic and often inaccurate coronavirus views will be punished \u2014 or made to atone. Read more  here . The Trump administration confirmed Wednesday that the government will devote an unspecified amount of federal aid to help hospitals cope with the expense of treating covid-19 patients who are uninsured. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the payments for patients without health coverage as part of several strands of funding the government will distribute from a federal relief package to hospitals and other health-care facilities and practitioners overwhelmed financially by the coronavirus pandemic. During a conference call with journalists, Azar declined to specify how much money would be allotted to help hospitals with covid-19 cases known as uncompensated care \u2014 patients for whom there is no one to pay the bills. Read more  here . Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards kicked off the virtual first meeting of a task force created to advise how to reopen the state economy, promising to release details next week on what will be permitted once the stay-at-home order expires April 30. The meeting of the Resilient Louisiana Commission, composed of representatives from the public and private sectors, was held Wednesday afternoon by telephone conference call with more than 100 task force members, businesspeople and reporters dialing in. Edwards (D) cautioned that when the state does start to reopen, the process will not necessarily be a \u201cone-way street\u201d toward fewer restrictions. If current trends reverse and covid-19 cases begin to increase, \u201cwe will go back to a more restrictive posture as we need to,\u201d he said. Edwards noted that the state is reopening portions of the health-care system relating to non-emergency medical procedures before the stay-at-home order expires. It\u2019s an example of how Louisiana must chart its own path toward reopening. The state\u2019s \u201cpopulation is already less healthy than the populations of just about every other state,\u201d Edwards said, and taking care of non-coronavirus cases is essential. \u201cWe\u2019re less healthy in ways that make more of our people vulnerable particularly to covid-19.\u201d The relative health of state residents will be a factor in the pace of reopening and the types of guidelines that will remain in place for some time, Edwards said. Louisiana reported 25,258 total cases and 1,473 deaths as of Wednesday, including 6,209 cases and 367 deaths in New Orleans. Louisiana has dropped to fifth place in the number of cases per capita after holding the third spot for weeks, Edwards said. The number of hospitalizations and patients requiring ventilators also decreased. \u201cI believe we can say we\u2019ve reached a plateau on cases,\u201d Edwards said, adding that \u201cnobody should think we\u2019re in the clear. We\u2019re not even close.\u201d Trump said he told Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) that he should wait longer before moving the state into phase two. \u201cOnly in timing, I disagree,\u201d Trump said. He added he campaigned for Kemp when he ran for office. \u201cI want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Trump said. Last week, after  saying he had \u201ctotal authority\u201d to reopen the country , Trump backed down, saying it was up to states. On Wednesday, after saying he disagreed with Kemp, he said he would act if governors\u2019 plans were concerning enough but implied Kemp\u2019s order didn\u2019t meet that standard. \u201cNow, if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I\u2019ll do [something],\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one\u2026 it\u2019s just too soon. I think it\u2019s too soon.\" Kemp\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to The Washington Post\u2019s request for comment on Trump\u2019s remarks, but on Twitter, Kemp doubled down on his decision to reopen, saying it was \u201cdriven by data and guided by state public health officials.\u201d \u201cWe will continue with this approach to protect the lives \u2014 and livelihoods \u2014 of all Georgians,\u201d he wrote. Earlier today, I discussed Georgia's plan to reopen shuttered businesses for limited operations with  @POTUS . I appreciate his bold leadership and insight during these difficult times and the framework provided by the White House to safely move states forward. (1/3)  #gapol Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaking after Trump during the White House briefing Wednesday, also said he would advise Kemp to reconsider his order. Trump had  tweeted  Wednesday morning that states are safely coming back. The vast majority of Americans \u2014 97 percent \u2014 reported practicing some form of social distancing in a  Gallup poll , but the remaining 3 percent have made no attempts to isolate themselves from people. And they came into contact with a relatively huge number of people every day. Gallup asked adults to count the number of people they came within six feet of during the previous day. On average, Americans reported contact with about 10 people in a given day. But that varied widely depending on how much people were trying to isolate themselves. Roughly 3 in 4 Americans said they were \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201cmostly\u201d isolating themselves, and they reported very few daily contacts. The average number of contacts for those who had mostly isolated themselves was 5.4, with most reporting fewer than three contacts per day. The average was 1.5 for those who were completely isolating. Contacts were dramatically higher among the 3 percent of adults who have made no attempt to isolate themselves. This group averaged 52 contacts per day, with a median of 30 contacts. An additional 7 percent reported isolating themselves \u201ca little,\u201d a group that also averaged 52 contacts per day but came into contact with a smaller 14 people typically. Most of those who made no attempt to isolate have jobs and may have limited ability to avoid people while working. Gallup found people with jobs were in contact with more people. The mean number of contacts among those working was about 14, compared with four for those who weren\u2019t working. Gallup found 52 percent of contacts Americans were having were at work, with 26 percent at the grocery store and fewer than 10 percent from any other location. President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday restricting certain categories of immigrants from entering the United States, but the measure contains broad exceptions and is more limited that the sweeping closure he described earlier in the week. The order blocks the entry of several categories of immigrants for 60 days, but it will not apply to immigrants already living and working in the United States who are seeking to become green-card holders as legal permanent residents. The spouses and children of U.S. citizens and permanent residents also will be unaffected, but other relatives seeking to immigrate will be blocked. Trump has said his restrictions could be extended far longer if he believes the U.S. economy could not absorb more immigrants, saying his move will protect American jobs at a time of  excessively high unemployment and economic uncertainty  due to the crisis. Read more  here.  Minutes after President Trump said the coronavirus would \u201cnever\u201d come back as intensely as it is right now, Anthony S. Fauci stood in front of him and said \u201cnobody can predict\u201d that. \u201cNobody can predict what is going to happen with an outbreak, but you can predict how you\u2019re going to respond to it,\u201d said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cI would caution against people thinking that in the fall there\u2019s not going to be coronavirus anymore and we won\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d he added. Trump has tried to paint a rosier picture of where the country stands in the pandemic, including how quickly the United States will come out of it without having to look back. Fauci also warned people, particularly in states beginning to reopen, against thinking the worst is over and jumping back into their normal lives now. \u201c I know the urge we all have to get out there and get it over with \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s get back to normal\u2019 \u2014 for a lot of good reasons, because there\u2019s a lot of suffering, economic and otherwise, in this country,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 But again \u2026 I plead with the American public, with the governors, with the mayors, for the people with responsibility, although I know one has the need to leapfrog over things, don\u2019t do that.\u201d In the phased, state-by-state process of reopening the country, California, Arkansas and Ohio made similar, slight strides on Wednesday. Each of the three states is starting to ease restrictions on elective or scheduled surgeries, which had been delayed during the coronavirus outbreak. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Wednesday that hospitals and other medical facilities can begin previously scheduled surgeries. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) asked medical providers to consult with patients and make a collective decision about scheduled surgeries that were put on hold by the pandemic. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) announced that, beginning Monday, the state will permit elective surgeries. The priority in Arkansas, like in Ohio and California, will be for patients who had procedures delayed by the virus. ISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey began releasing tens of thousands of prisoners last week to stop a spiraling coronavirus outbreak from racing through its overstuffed jails. But Selma Altan, who is 71 and especially vulnerable because of a respiratory condition, was among a group of prisoners left behind, charged with what human rights groups say are political crimes. A justice reform law passed by parliament last week that would temporarily or permanently release tens of thousands of prisoners excluded inmates serving time for more serious crimes and people like Altan, a prisoners\u2019 rights advocate who was accused of terrorism.

There was a fierce debate, but the panel was expected to approve the framework for Thursday\u2019s debate on the creation of a 12-member select committee to oversee the trillions of dollars spent on the coronavirus pandemic. Rather than the tiny room the panel uses on the third floor of the Capitol, the Rules Committee convened across the street in an expansive hearing room. Lawmakers sat far away from each at a massive dais, usually reserved for the much larger Ways and Means Committee, with Republicans and Democrats alike donning masks. Some wore gloves, including Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.). Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a Rules Committee member, grew angry at the only witness on hand, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), \u2014 who testified against the proposed new committee \u2014 because he was not wearing a mask. Jordan countered that he was adhering to federal guidelines and was seated far away from anyone, but Raskin asked Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the committee chairman, whether rules set out by the Office of Attending Physician required Jordan to wear a mask. McGovern, after double-checking with someone from that medical staff, said that masks were \u201crecommended\u201d but not required. Later, Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.) thanked the lawmakers and staff who wore masks to the hearing, then stared at Jordan as she added, \u201cIt\u2019s the responsible thing to do.\u201d President Trump began his evening coronavirus briefing by rebutting a  Washington Post  story that quoted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield warning that the coronavirus could be more challenging if it has a resurgence in the fall. Trump called Redfield to the lectern to also dispute the story, but the CDC director gave a murky statement and confirmed that he was quoted accurately by The Post. \u201c I didn\u2019t say that this was going to be worse. I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated because we\u2019ll have flu and coronavirus circulated at the same time,\u201d Redfield said. . @weijia  just asked an important Q. Why did the  @CDCDirector  tweet The Washington Post article if he had a problem with the headline?  Neither Redfield nor Pres Trump answered her & instead Trump said, \"You were not called.\" Here's Redfield tweeting out  @bylenasun 's story.  pic.twitter.com/Jo4vDJ7Vfo Redfield parsed that while his quote in the story was correct, the headline on the story that said he warned of a \u201cdevastating\u201d coronavirus comeback was \u201cout of line.\u201d Redfield, on Tuesday night, tweeted the Post story to his followers. When a reporter attempted to ask him why he shared it, Trump cut her off and said she hadn\u2019t been called on to speak. Trump insisted that the coronavirus will \u201cnot be coming back in the form that it was.\u201d \u201c What we\u2019ve just gone through, we will not go through. You could have some embers of corona, and you can have a big flu system, and if they combine, if they come together, it\u2019s not great. But we will not go through what we went through for the last two months,\u201d Trump said. Turning to Redfield, Trump asked, \u201cIs that a correct statement?\u201d \u201cCorrect,\u201d Redfield said. A multibillion-dollar standoff between the nation\u2019s leading insurers and the restaurants, hotels, gyms and theaters that purchase their policies has spilled into some of the most powerful corridors of Washington, as both sides clash over who should foot the sky-high costs of the  coronavirus  outbreak. The battle hinges on whether insurance providers should have to pay claims to companies that have shuttered unexpectedly as a result of the  deadly pandemic . The dispute has attracted the attention of President Trump, triggered lawsuits in courtrooms nationwide and touched off a massive lobbying blitz on Capitol Hill, where some insurers say the federal government should be the one providing financial help to those that need it most.

Ron DeSantis (R) stood up for Florida residents on Wednesday after social media posts poked fun at  photos and videos of a crowd at a Florida beach that had just reopened  \u2014 raising concerns that the coronavirus could spread among those people. #FloridaMorons began to trend on Twitter a day after the photos and videos showed people gathered, not all with masks or keeping a distance of six feet from others, at the Jacksonville beach. The same day, Florida reported 58 deaths from the virus, which was then its highest daily toll since the pandemic began. While praising Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and city residents for its low number of coronavirus hospitalizations, DeSantis criticized \u201cthe Acela corridor,\u201d referring to Amtrak\u2019s flagship track through large northeastern cities, including Washington, D.C., and New York City, for \"taking potshots at Jacksonville.\u201d Duval County, where Jacksonville is located, has 6.9 people hospitalized per 100,000, which is lower than larger cities that have experienced more cases, such as New York City, DeSantis said. \u201cFor those who try to say you\u2019re morons,\u201d he said, speaking to Florida residents, \u201cI\u2019ll take you over those who criticize you every day of the week and twice on Sunday.\u201d By the end of the week, residents in Georgia will be able to get their hair permed and nails done. And it will almost certainly lead to more novel coronavirus infections and deaths. As several states \u2014 including South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida \u2014 rush to reopen businesses, the sudden relaxation of restrictions will supply new targets for the coronavirus that has kept the United States largely shut down, according to experts, math models and the basic rules that govern infectious diseases. \u201cThe math is unfortunately pretty simple. It\u2019s not a matter of whether infections will increase but by how much,\u201d said Jeffrey Shaman, a leading epidemiologist at Columbia University. Closing America was hard. But it came with one simple instruction: Everyone stay at home. There are no easy answers for the phase that comes next, especially with a continued lack of testing, contact tracing and detailed guidance from federal health agencies, disease experts said. Instead, every state will conduct its own improvised experiment with thousands of lives in the balance. And newly emerging science shows just how hard that is going to be. Read more  here . Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which was involved in work on a coronavirus vaccine and treatments, said Wednesday that he was removed from his post for resisting efforts to \u201cprovide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.\u201d \u201cSidelining me in the middle of this pandemic and placing politics and cronyism ahead of science puts lives at risk and stunts national efforts to safely and effectively address this urgent public health crisis,\u201d Bright said in a statement that was first reported by the New York Times. President Trump has repeatedly pushed the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential cure-all for coronavirus despite scant evidence about the drug\u2019s efficacy. Recent evidence has shown the drug does not work and can be dangerous for patients. Bright said his resistance toward pushing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as a panacea and his insistence that the government invest billions of dollars appropriated by Congress into scientifically vetted solutions led to clashes with political leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services, which BARDA is under. Bright was moved to a narrower role at National Institutes of Health this week. Two senior administration officials said he repeatedly clashed with his boss, Robert Kadlec, the assistant HHS secretary for preparedness and response. One person familiar with the situation said Bright\u2019s departure had been discussed by agency officials before the pandemic due to dissatisfaction with his job performance. The administration has worked with outside companies, including Oracle, to set up a website that would collect anecdotal evidence of doctors\u2019 use of hydroxychloroquine and other potential treatments. \u201cI rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public,\u201d Bright said. \u201cI also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections.\u201d Coronavirus testing should be ramped up at homeless shelters, which are susceptible to viral outbreaks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in  a study  published Wednesday. This multicity report, and another released Wednesday, highlighted dangers  that the coronavirus poses at shelters , which can be crowded and filled with people  who are older or have health issues , placing them in particular peril. The CDC\u2019s multicity report said public health teams responded in late March and early April to coronavirus clusters at shelters in Boston, San Francisco and Seattle. (Clusters are defined as at least two cases in the previous two weeks). A team in Atlanta gave proactive tests to residents and staff at two shelters that had no known cases in the preceding weeks. In total, they conducted tests in 19 shelters, testing more than 1,100 people staying at the facilities and more than 300 staff members. The results were stark. In San Francisco, two-thirds of homeless shelter residents tested had positive results. So did more than a third in Boston. About 1 in 6 residents tested at the Seattle shelters did, as well, with similar shares of staff members at those shelters and in San Francisco. In Atlanta, infections were relatively rare at shelters where no cases had been reported. This report acknowledges limitations \u2014 including that some residents and staff members were not tested. But it urged shelters to allow residents to stay farther apart and encourage face coverings. The CDC said that because of \u201cthe high proportion\u201d of cases found and evidence that the virus can be transmitted without symptoms, testing of all residents and staff should be considered after clusters \u2014 or before clusters are found, if testing can be accessed. A  report  focusing on Seattle, meanwhile, noted that like nursing homes, homeless shelters \u201care densely populated environments \u2026 which can amplify infectious disease outbreaks.\u201d That report focused on three shelters in the city, finding that about 1 in 5 residents and staff members tested positive. On Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) laid out specific plans to expand coronavirus testing in the state, while simultaneously saying a shutdown must continue. Newsom\u2019s comments come amid state-by-state efforts to restart the economy. And while Newsom hopes his testing blueprint will be a step toward doing so, he is not ready to restart normal life in California. \u201cI deeply recognize, deeply understand the desire for people to hear directly from the administration, from the state and its leadership, about the answer to when, when can we go back to some semblance of normalcy,\u201d Newsom said during his daily news media briefing Wednesday. He then added that those decisions will be guided by the virus and its spread, and that the first priority will always be public health. Newsom announced Wednesday that the state\u2019s hospital system is in good shape, and can begin to schedule surgeries that were previously put on hold by the coronavirus outbreak. Newsom noted that this applies to both hospitals and other medical facilities. California has experienced a shortage of swabs needed for coronavirus testing, and Newsom said 100,000 are expected to arrive this week, and 250,000 next week. He also described a plan to train 10,000 people to help track covid-19 patients throughout the state, adding that California has the \u201ccapacity to build an army of tracers.\u201d Newsom then expects the results of these efforts \u2014 more testing, better tracking \u2014 to dictate when shutdown measures can ease. Global markets rebounded Wednesday following a wild two-day slide in the price of oil that had unnerved investors and sent major indexes due south. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 456 points, or 2 percent. The blue-chip index had clawed back much of the nearly 1,000 points it gave up the first two days of the week with help from technology stocks such as Apple, Intel and Microsoft and surprising gains from oil giants Chevron and ExxonMobil. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index also posted strong advances. The market surge is also partly a response to states moving to reopen their economies after weeks of coronavirus-related lockdowns. New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) is beginning to outline the early stages of how the hardest-hit state in the pandemic will start to loosen restrictions. Read more  here . LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s extraordinary first \u201cParliament via Zoom\u201d proceeded Wednesday in rather ordinary fashion, with the usual barbed questions and artful evasion by politicians, plus the addition of awkward views of oversize chins and bookshelves staged as backdrops. Everything was the same \u2014 and everything was a little odd. Breaking 700 years of tradition , the British Parliament has agreed to serve as a cradle of virtual democracy \u2014 to allow members to continue to debate, vote and legislate, but via videoconferencing app, from the safety of their homes, for the duration of Britain\u2019s  coronavirus  lockdown. On Wednesday, there were a few minor technical hiccups. Some lawmakers\u2019 heads were cropped at the eyebrows by the bad framing. Their mics were sometimes too close or too far away, or the Internet connection was bad, so voices sounded tinny or muffled or like Darth Vader. But all in all, for no rehearsals? Not a bad opening matinee. Read more  here.  House Republican leaders on Wednesday pressed for Congress to return to Washington rather than explore ways of conducting remote voting as the coronavirus pandemic continues to disrupt business and government operations across the country. At a news conference with other GOP leaders outside the Capitol Wednesday afternoon, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Congress should return to regular business as an example for the rest of the country. \u201cCongress is essential,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe American public needs to see that we\u2019re working. The American public has to understand that we can do it in a safe manner so states and others could begin to open as well.\u201d House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) noted the route the House has taken is different from how Trump has handled business during the coronavirus. \u201cEvery day, the president goes to work in the White House. \u2026 And yet, you see the House of Representatives, the People\u2019s House, shut down,\u201d Scalise said. One key difference between Congress and the White House, however, is the fact that there are more than 400 House members, making it more difficult for them to social distance compared with the president and his staff. A day after Harvard University drew the ire of President Trump, the school has announced it will not accept money from the Cares Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund. In a series of tweets, Harvard said it \u201cdid not apply for this support, nor has it requested, received or accessed the funds\u201d dedicated to helping colleges navigate the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, during a White House media briefing, Trump said Harvard would have to pay back funds received through the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. Harvard quickly rebutted Trump\u2019s claim, tweeting that it has not received PPP funds or applied for a program designed for small businesses. In that same series of tweets, Harvard wrote that it had been allocated funds as part of the Cares Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund and planned to use them to \u201cprovide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d Harvard faced criticism for potentially receiving taxpayer money. It was further stoked by Trump on Tuesday, when he mentioned the elite university\u2019s endowment and repeated they should pay back any money they received through a federal program. Now the university says it will not apply for or accept any Cares funding. \u201cWe are concerned that intense focus by politicians & others on Harvard in connection with the program may undermine participation in a relief effort Congress created & the president signed into law for the purpose of helping those whose financial challenges may be most severe,\u201d Harvard tweeted, before continuing: \u201cAs a result of this, and the evolving guidance being issued around use of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, Harvard has decided not to seek or accept the funds allocated to it by statute.\u201d As European countries start to ease coronavirus restrictions and open up schools, some parents will have to weigh their fears of the virus against compulsory schooling policies. Switzerland announced primary schools will reopen May 11 \u2014 but some parents are worried that\u2019s too soon to send their children back. If they choose to keep their children at home, they could face fines of thousands of dollars, depending on where in the country they live,  reports the Local . While data shows children are not particularly at risk of the novel coronavirus, there is concern that they can be carriers and bring the virus home. Switzerland has reported less than 1,000 confirmed cases among children and no deaths. Other countries in Europe,  including France , have said parents can keep their children home after schools open as long as they ensure they are receiving an adequate education. School closures connected to the virus have affected an  estimated  1.5 billion children worldwide. Some studies have raised questions over whether keeping schools closed out of caution is worth the cost in lost educational opportunities. A  study  published in the Lancet medical journal in early April noted that past school closures in response to the SARS outbreak in mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore did not significantly help control the epidemic. TORONTO \u2014 Ontario and Quebec, both hit hard by deadly outbreaks of the novel coronavirus at long-term-care facilities, are asking Ottawa for military assistance to help reduce the virus\u2019s spread. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Wednesday that he would be making a formal request for military assistance to be deployed at five \u201cpriority\u201d seniors\u2019 facilities in the province. The personnel would help staff and coordinate medical care and logistics. Fran\u00e7ois Legault, Quebec\u2019s premier, asked the federal government for 1,000 Canadian armed forces members to help at its long-term-care homes, which have an estimated shortage of 2,000 workers. The Canadian military already deployed 125 medical technicians, nursing officers and other staff to the province\u2019s struggling facilities  earlier this month . Like other jurisdictions, Ontario and Quebec have banned most visits to long-term-care facilities. Advocates say low wages, chronic underfunding, poor infection control and shortages of personal protective equipment make it difficult to inhibit the outbreaks. Last week, Canada\u2019s top doctor expressed \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that social distancing measures were working to slow the pandemic, but she said long-term-care facilities remained an area of concern as nearly half of the country\u2019s coronavirus deaths are linked to the residences. \u201cAlmost all jurisdictions are essentially trying to deal with the outbreaks in long-term-care facilities,\u201d Theresa Tam told reporters. \u201cEven as the numbers of cases slow down, the number of deaths, unfortunately, are expected to increase.\u201d Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll surpassed 25,000 on Wednesday, when  authorities confirmed  another 437 deaths in the past day. The tally marked a decrease of 97 deaths compared with Tuesday, but authorities also confirmed an uptick in the  number of new cases , with 3,370 diagnoses confirmed in the past day compared with 2,729 the day before. There are currently 2,384 patients in intensive care in Italy, marking a small daily decline. Meanwhile, France recorded 3,201 new cases of the virus in the past day as its death toll climbed by 544, bringing the country\u2019s total number of deaths linked to the virus to 21,340. The number of patients in French hospitals dropped by 365, marking the  eighth day in a row  that data point has fallen, although  the number of new cases  was higher than in the past several days. In Spain,  authorities confirmed  another 4,211 cases of coronavirus and another 435 deaths. The country\u2019s total death toll is now 21,717. In Britain, an additional 759 people who contracted coronavirus died in hospitals in the past day, bringing the total to 18,100. The full death toll is expected to be significantly higher as officials gather data on deaths that occurred in nursing homes and other non-hospital settings. Researchers in Britain are moving forward with vaccine trials, but Chris Whitty, chief medical officer in England,  said at a briefing Wednesday  that \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures will need to remain in place for through the end of the year. President Trump plans to \u201cmove swiftly\u201d to expand his use of the Defense Production Act to boost private production of critical medical supplies, both for the current pandemic and to prepare for future crises, said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. Navarro, who identified himself as the administration\u2019s \u201cDPA Policy Coordinator,\u201d said the less coercive portions of the broad war-era act could be useful in incentivizing private companies to bolster their supply lines and mass produce key equipment needed for the coronavirus response. \u201cAs Congress adds funds to DPA Title III, this invaluable tool can be strategically used to provide both surge capacity and longer run capabilities through funding key projects,\u201d he said in an interview with The Post. He pointed to the administration\u2019s current plans to use Title III of the act to provide federal funding for Maine-based Puritan Medical Products. The company will manufacture 20 million additional swabs for coronavirus testing each month. The administration is also open to using the \u201cheavier hand\u201d of the DPA in rare cases where private enterprise is unable to meet the country\u2019s public health needs, he said. At the same time, he said the \u201cpatriotic cooperation\u201d from private companies so far has been \u201castonishing and heartwarming.\u201d Critics have accused the president of being too slow to invoke the DPA to force companies to act. Former vice president Joe Biden has said Trump\u2019s reluctance to use his broad powers has exacerbated shortages of personal protective equipment and testing supplies. In addition to the DPA, Navarro said the White House is considering several policy changes to boost domestic medical manufacturing over the long term \u2014 including \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements for federal agencies purchasing medicine and medical supplies. GENEVA \u2014 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, defended his agency\u2019s work on the coronavirus on Wednesday, and warned that the pandemic would be \u201cwith us for a long time.\u201d \"Most of the epidemics in Western Europe appear to be stable or declining,\u201d Tedros said during a daily briefing in Geneva, but he added that there were \u201cworrying upward trends\u201d in Africa, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe. \u201cMost countries are still in the early stages of their epidemics,\u201d he said, and other nations are seeing a resurgence. WHO has been a lightning rod for criticism during the pandemic, with much of the ire focused on Tedros, an Ethiopian health expert who trained as a microbiologist. During the briefing, the director-general and other officials defended the organization\u2019s conduct, including the decision not to name the outbreak as a pandemic until March 11. Tedros said that an earlier announcement on Jan. 30 was the highest level of alert possible and should have given states time to respond. \u201cWe triggered the highest level of emergency when the rest of the world had only 82 cases and no deaths,\u201d he said. The WHO chief warned that the public unrest against social distancing measures now seen in the United States and other countries \"will only fuel the outbreak,\u201d while Mike Ryan, the organization\u2019s chief emergency expert, said he had seen in the past that genuine public concerns could be deliberately inflamed. \u201cThere are many situations in which those reactions and community sentiments are gamed and directed in a way that is counterproductive,\u201d Ryan said, comparing the demonstrations during coronavirus outbreak with protests he had seen against anti-Ebola measures in Congo. MANILA \u2014 President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s order to kill quarantine violators has become more than a threat in the Philippines. A viral video shared on social media and by local news outlets Wednesday showed police apparently shooting a man dead, reportedly for flouting lockdown rules. Local media outlets obtained the video, taken Tuesday afternoon in Quezon City, and identified the victim as an army veteran named Winston Ragos. The video showed Ragos asking a police officer, \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with me?\u201d When he looks like he is about to pull something out of his bag, two shots ring out. He throws his bag to the side before collapsing. A woman can also be heard crying, screaming that police should have searched him first and fired a warning shot. Video from a different angle shows that at least five policemen were on site. Authorities later said Ragos was carrying a gun, but his family denied the allegations in a  report from broadcaster GMA News.  They said that he had schizophrenia and post-traumatic disorder, after being deployed to fight Islamic State-affiliated militants in a 2017 siege. \u201cForeign leaders may think Duterte is just full of bluster, but his words are directly responsible in life-or-death situations playing out on the streets, with cops thinking they have impunity to shoot anyone,\u201d said Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cA squad of cops killed a mentally ill man in cold blood because they knew they could.\u201d Ragos is not the first reported death due to police action since \u201cenhanced community quarantine\u201d over most of the Philippines came into effect last month. In two previous instances, officers also said that the person killed attacked first. The shootings under lockdown come amid a broader clampdown by Duterte, whose drug war has left thousands dead. Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) acknowledged violating a stocks disclosure law related to transactions that came to light following her appointment to a new commission that will oversee disbursements of federal funds from the $2 trillion coronavirus response package. After her appointment last week to the five-member panel by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Shalala drew scrutiny for holdings detailed in a 2018 disclosure form from companies that could be eligible to seek federal bailouts, a potential conflict of interest. In response to the criticism, Shalala said she had sold a range of stocks in 2019 after she arrived in Congress following a lengthy career in academia and a stint as health and human services secretary during the Clinton administration. Those sales, however, were not disclosed as required by the Stock Act, a 2012 law that prohibits members of Congress from benefiting financially from information gleaned from their official positions. The violation of the act, which Shalala aides characterized as an honest mistake, was first reported by the Miami Herald. Aides say Shalala\u2019s situation was complicated by plans to place her assets in a blind trust, which would not require her to disclose stock sales made without her knowledge. But the blind trust has not been finalized. \u201cIt was my mistake, and I take full responsibility,\u201d Shalala told the Miami CBS affiliate on Wednesday, adding that as a new congresswoman she was trying to unload her stocks in 2019 to avoid any conflicts of interest related to her new responsibilities. She said she notified the House Ethics Commission of her transgression and is prepared to accept a fine or \u201cwhatever they think is appropriate.\u201d The Congressional Oversight Commission includes appointees from the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said Shalala continues to have \u201cthe Speaker\u2019s complete confidence\u201d in her commission role. \u201cRep. Shalala has taken responsibility for her mistake in missing filings required under the STOCK Act and has been working the Ethics Committee to address this issue since she became aware of it,\u201d he said in a statement. Two pet cats in New York have tested positive for the coronavirus that causes covid-19 in humans, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. The cats live in different parts of the state, and both showed symptoms of mild respiratory illness and are expected to recover, the agencies said in a statement. One cat is owned by a person who tested positive for the coronavirus before the cat showed symptoms; the second lives in a household where no members had confirmed cases of the virus. It is possible this cat was infected by a household member who was mildly ill or asymptomatic, the statement said. The cats represent the second and third confirmed U.S. cases of the coronavirus in animals. Earlier this month, a Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive after coming down with a cough. Outside of the United States, pet dogs and a cat in Hong Kong, as well as a cat in Belgium, have tested positive. Other animals, including ferrets, have been shown to be susceptible in laboratory tests. The CDC, the World Health Organization and other public health officials say there is no evidence pets can pass the virus to humans. In the past week, the World Health Organization recorded a 43 percent increase in novel coronavirus cases across the agency\u2019s African region, which includes most countries on the continent but excludes some parts of North Africa and the Horn of Africa. On April 14, the WHO  had confirmed  a total of 10,759 cases in the region. By April 21,  the total had jumped  to 15,394, the agency said Wednesday. The number of deaths linked to the virus rose from 520 to 716. South Africa remains the most affected country in the region, having confirmed 3,465 cases as of Tuesday. Algeria had 2,811 confirmed cases, Cameroon had 1,163 cases, and Ghana had 1,042. Those four countries make up 55 percent of the region\u2019s total cases. \u201cThe number of new confirmed cases continues to increase every week, albeit at a slower pace than previously, thus indicating that the peak of the outbreak has not yet been reached,\u201d the report said. Countries that have reported fewer than 100 cases need to intensify measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the WHO said, including \u201cactive case finding, testing and isolation of cases, contact tracing, physical distancing and promotion of good personal hygiene practices.\u201d In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signaled Wednesday that he is intent on Congress returning to session on May 4, even though many states have yet to reopen due to the coronavirus pandemic. McConnell made the remark in a discussion with Hewitt, who is also a Washington Post opinion columnist, about the trillions of dollars that the recent coronavirus relief legislation will add to the national debt. \u201cThe only solution is ultimately to begin to open up,\u201d McConnell said. \"I was encouraged the White House task force set up Phase 1. Many governors are now looking at beginning to carefully reopen. And I think that\u2019s the only way we can ultimately solve this problem is to begin the process of getting back to normal.\u201d In an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, McConnell made a similar comment, arguing that \u201cwaving $2.7 trillion through the Senate and the House on voice votes is not the way the Congress was set up to function.\u201d He added that \"we ought to deal with this the way Congress normally would, with full attendance in the Capitol, doing our work.\u201d New York will launch a program that aims to test, trace and isolate people suspected of being infected with the novel coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said Wednesday. In a news conference, the governor announced that he, Gov. Phil Murphy (D-N.J.) and Gov. Ned Lamont (D-Conn.) will coordinate on plans to build a \u201ctracing army.\u201d \u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t stop at jurisdictional boundaries,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThe virus just spreads.\u201d Former New York mayor and recent Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg has volunteered to develop the \u201cfirst-ever testing, tracing and isolation program\u201d in the state, Cuomo said. Bloomberg\u2019s financial contribution to the coordinated effort with the state is upward of $10 million. He will design the new program and create systems to hire and train contact tracers. Johns Hopkins University and Vital Strategies will coordinate work downstate and in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The State University of New York and the City University of New York will draw from 35,000 students in medical fields who can serve as tracers, Cuomo said. The move comes as New York\u2019s death total continues to inch toward 15,000, with 474 people dying Tuesday. Hospitalizations and intubations continue to trend downward, but the number of people walking into hospitals and testing positive is still \u201cproblematic,\u201d the governor said. Cuomo said that his conversation with President Trump on Tuesday was productive and resulted in the president agreeing to waive the requirement that the state pay part of the costs incurred by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to Cuomo. \u201cNormally, a state has to pay 25 percent of the FEMA cost. That would be a cruel irony for New York and adding insult to injury,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York had the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country.\u201d Within the state, local politicians and officials have flooded his phone line about pressure to reopen, Cuomo said, adding that he would take the blame for the continued closings of many businesses and jobs. \u201cDon\u2019t make a decision based on political pressure,\u201d he said. \u201c'I get the pressure, but we can\u2019t make the bad decision. This is no time to act stupidly.\u201d One month ago, covid-19 appeared to be a standard-variety respiratory virus, albeit a very contagious and lethal one with no vaccine and no treatment. But many doctors are now reporting bizarre, unsettling cases that do not seem to follow the textbooks they have trained on. They describe patients with startlingly low oxygen \u2014 so low they would normally be unconscious or near death \u2014 talking and swiping on their phones. Asymptomatic pregnant women suddenly in cardiac arrest. Some scientists now hypothesize that at least some of these abnormalities may be explained by blood-clotting complications. Read more  here . Amid rising unemployment worldwide, global remittances are expected to fall by 20 percent, or nearly $110 billion, in 2020, the World Bank said in a report Wednesday. \u201cThe projected fall, which would be the sharpest decline in recent history, is largely due to a fall in the wages and employment of migrant workers, who tend to be more vulnerable to loss of employment and wages during an economic crisis in a host country,\u201d the Washington-based development bank  said in a statement . The World Bank estimated that remittances sent to families in low- and middle-income countries would fall by 19.7 percent to $445 billion \u2014 a severe loss for many of the world\u2019s most economically vulnerable populations. \u201cStudies show that remittances alleviate poverty in lower- and middle-income countries, improve nutritional outcomes, are associated with higher spending on education, and reduce child labor in disadvantaged households,\u201d the World Bank said. \u201cA fall in remittances affect families\u2019 ability to spend on these areas as more of their finances will be directed to solve food shortages and immediate livelihoods needs.\u201d As The Washington Post has reported , the pandemic and resulting economic upheaval have upended the lives of millions of families, which despite the dangers and indignities, depend on relatives crossing countries or continents to find work and send money home. \u201cMany Latin Americans and Africans depend on remittances from relatives in the United States,\u201d The Post reported. \u201cEgypt and other Middle Eastern nations, meanwhile, attract millions of Asian migrant workers, who send home significant shares of their earnings. After the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are the world\u2019s largest sources of remittances, much of the money flowing to Asian nations led by India, China and the Philippines.\u201d A South Dakota track plans to hold an auto race as scheduled Saturday, although Gov. Kristi L. Noem urged people to stay home. \u201cI\u2019m going to strongly recommend to the people of South Dakota that they not go and that they stay home,\u201d said Noem (R), who has not issued a stay-at-home order in the state. \u201cWe\u2019re asking that they be wise and smart to continue on the path and plan we\u2019ve laid out for South Dakota for several more weeks.\u201d Promoters plan to limit ticket sales to 700 for the Open Wheel Nationals at the 4,000-seat venue in North Sioux City. Adam Adamson, the co-promoter of the race, told the  Argus Leader  that tickets have been presold, that concessions must be purchased with credit cards and that a 10-person clubhouse in which fans can watch races will be closed. \u201cWe intend to go overboard on following CDC guidelines,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just a small racetrack in rural South Dakota trying to give some entertainment and a little bit of a break from some of this madness that\u2019s going on right now. We think we can do so in a safe environment.\u201d There will be two fields of competition (sprint cars and IMCA modifieds), with each limited to 32 entries at a track that typically can accommodate 150. \u201cThe way we figured it, we could probably have a little over 900 people with six feet apart between each person, and we\u2019re actually only selling 700 seats, not even 900,\u201d co-promoter Terry Carl said. \u201cWe actually went way less than that just to give people more room. There isn\u2019t community transmission in that county, and according to the CDC, we\u2019re still eligible to do what we want to do.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi abruptly postponed plans to change House rules this week to allow a form of remote voting for the first time in the chamber\u2019s 230-year history after Republicans objected to the plan. Instead, she told fellow House Democratic leaders on a Wednesday morning conference call, the issue would be closely studied by a bipartisan group led by Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), as well as the leaders of the Rules and House Administration committees. Pelosi\u2019s decision was described by two Democratic aides familiar with the call. Pelosi (D-Calif.) had said in public comments earlier this month that any rules change would have to be strictly bipartisan, but Democrats over the past week vowed to move forward with a proxy voting arrangement that would allow members to authorize a colleague to cast a floor vote on their behalf. The House Rules Committee released the text of the proposal early Wednesday ahead of an expected Thursday vote. Pelosi said on the call that the House would vote instead on a resolution creating a previously announced special committee to conduct oversight of the trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief money handed out by Congress over the past two months. Republicans have opposed that committee, to be led by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), calling it duplicative of existing oversight mechanisms. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke to several world leaders by phone in the past day, including President Trump, about the World Health Organization and international responses to the coronavirus pandemic, he confirmed in tweets on Wednesday. The conversations came amid growing calls within the Australian government for an independent inquiry into how the coronavirus outbreak emerged in China and how the international community handled the outbreak. Trump stoked controversy last week when he announced abruptly he would halt U.S. funding to the WHO, citing concerns over its handling of the outbreak. Several U.S. allies rallied behind the agency, saying they disagreed with Trump backing away from the organization during a global health crisis. Morrison, a Trump ally, said in a tweet the two discussed the U.N. agency and \u201cworking together to improve the transparency & effectiveness of international responses to pandemics.\u201d He also said Australia and the United States are \u201cthe best of mates\u201d and will \u201ccontinue to our align our efforts as we work toward the recovery on the other side of this virus.\u201d In another tweet, Morrison said he also spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Reuters reported that Morrison attempted to shore up support for an international investigation into how the coronavirus emerged. An Elysee official told Reuters Macron \u201cagrees that there have been some issues at the start, but that the urgency is for cohesion, that it is no time to talk about this, while reaffirming the need for transparency for all players, not only the WHO.\u201d What is the biggest problem facing America? Unsurprisingly, the leading answer this month is the coronavirus, according to Gallup. A  new poll  from Gallup, conducted earlier this month and released this week, found that the coronavirus was mentioned by 45 percent of people asked that question \u2014 nearly identical to the share who said terrorism in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. People contacted for the poll were reached between April 1 and April 14 \u2014 a period that saw  deaths from the virus  quintuple in the United States \u2014 and asked their view of the country\u2019s most important problem. After the coronavirus/disease, the second most-common response was \"government/poor leadership,\u201d according to Gallup. Following that, people were concerned about the economy and health care. Gallup polling  this month  has also found that Americans are more concerned about getting the virus itself (57 percent) than they are about suffering severe financial issues due to its fallout (48 percent). The United Nations has confirmed the first novel coronavirus case in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, raising alarm about the potential for outbreaks in the country\u2019s numerous encampments and neighborhoods housing Palestinians and Syrians. UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, announced Tuesday night that the patient had been taken to a state-run hospital in Beirut. By Wednesday, Lebanese authorities in coordination with local Palestinian factions had put the Wavel camp in the Bekaa Valley on lockdown, Agence France-Presse reported. The patient was a Palestinian refugee from Syria, according to UNRWA. Worldwide, the United Nations estimates that more than 70 million people have been displaced by war, conflict and persecution, including about 30 million refugees and asylum seekers. Advocates have warned that these populations are particularly high risk if exposed to the coronavirus, as they often have limited access to health care and live in crowded camps or impoverished neighborhoods. Health-care providers and aid groups are especially concerned about undetected cases among refugees allowing the coronavirus to proliferate. Along with the general shortages of testing kits, there are other challenges in conflict zones that involve the transportation of materials and access to communities. In war-torn northeastern Syria, for example, it took two weeks for the first coronavirus patient to be tested and confirmed as positive. On Tuesday, Doctors Without Borders called on authorities in the Iraqi region of Kurdistan and in northeastern Syria to facilitate the movement of humanitarian workers and aid between the two areas. In the besieged Gaza Strip, UNRWA is bracing for an outbreak given the paucity of health-care resources for the territory\u2019s 2 million residents, and more than half are refugees. On Wednesday, the Israeli military halted the processing of tests conducted in Hamas-ruled Gaza following coordination issues, Israeli media reported. Another major pork production plant is shutting down over a spike in coronavirus cases, further straining the U.S. meat supply chain and raising fears of potential shortages. Tyson Foods said Wednesday it is closing its plant in Waterloo, Iowa, where it has 2,800 employees and processes 19,500 hogs a day. It is Tyson\u2019s largest pork plant and represents about 4 percent of the nation\u2019s pork processing capacity. The closure follows other shutdowns at plants run by Smithfield Foods, JBS USA and other companies. Read more  here . New York City will host a July 4 celebration despite still having widespread coronavirus transmission, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio (D). The mayor announced at a Wednesday news conference that the city is working with Macy\u2019s to plan a celebration, though there are still few details. The commemoration of America\u2019s independence is one New York City cannot miss as a symbol of the city\u2019s strength and resilience, he said. The mayor called Macy\u2019s \u201cpatriotic\u201d for pushing forward with the effort in the face of major economic disruption. Macy\u2019s  said in late March  that it would furlough most of its 125,000 workers and shut down some 775 stores during the pandemic. \u201cThe cost of a [fireworks] display is minimal in the scheme of things,\u201d de Blasio told a reporter who asked about the financial costs of a firework display. While the celebration might offer hope to New York City residents, the reality is that the metropolis is still in a high-level transmission phase in dealing with the coronavirus, he said. De Blasio said the city still needs to get in the low-level transmission phase, which includes greater testing capacity, less social distancing and better contact tracing. The mayor said he couldn\u2019t provide an exact date for that. In an effort to get there, de Blasio also announced a \u201cTest and Trace\u201d program with a goal of having available testing in every community and the ability to trace contacts with the infected and isolate those who test positive. The mayor said the city found one company that will give a steady supply but noted that to test at the scale that the new plan envisions, more tests will be needed. \u201cToo often we\u2019ve been left on our own to fend for ourselves,\u201d he said, repeating his comments about how the federal government hasn\u2019t done enough for his city. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the quantities [of testing], all the other pieces won\u2019t come together.\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted Wednesday that most, if not all, of the U.S. economy will have reopened by late summer. \u201cI hope we are going to get back to work fairly quickly,\u201d Mnuchin said in an interview on Fox Business Network. \u201cAnd, you know, we\u2019re kind of operating under the environment that we are going to open up parts of the economy. And we\u2019re looking forward to, by the time we get later in the summer, having most of the economy, if not all of the economy, open.\"  Public health authorities such as Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have urged caution in reopening the economy, warning that the progress of the coronavirus is unpredictable. Fauci has also suggested that some level of social distancing may need to remain in place until a coronavirus vaccine is developed. Medical workers across Russia are increasingly raising the alarm about a lack of protective equipment, and they claim coronavirus rates are spiking among staff in hospitals and clinics. But Russian authorities appear to be stepping up their intimidation of anyone speaking out about shortages and infections in health-care ranks, as the covid-19 pandemic expands across the country. Allegations that Russian officials are covering up critical truths \u2014 such as infection rates among health-care workers \u2014 is the latest example of how the need for public facts in the pandemic fight can often collide with authoritarian controls. The perception of secrecy has frayed many Russians\u2019 already low trust of health authorities and increased their skepticism of official information about the crisis. Read more  here . U.S. stocks rebounded Wednesday after a  two-day sell-off  as oil prices stabilized. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 419 points, or 1.8 percent, at the open. The blue-chip index had erased nearly 1,000 points over two days. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index both surged 2.1 percent. West Texas intermediate crude oil, which sold for less than $0 a barrel earlier in the week, hovered near $11 on Wednesday morning on its June contract. Brent crude, which hit an 18-year low Tuesday, was up 5.3 percent, to $20.32 a barrel Wednesday. The improvement remains a fraction of the $50 or so needed for a producer to make money. The oil crash comes amid a sharp decline in demand as the coronavirus pandemic has slashed business and social activity worldwide. That has created a glut, which is straining storage capacity.

Another ran 262 \u00bd miles to win the Quarantine Backyard Ultra in his Northern Virginia neighborhood. Then there\u2019s Rob Ferguson. A  fellow of the Royal Geographical Society  and ambassador for outdoor brand Arc\u2019teryx, he is a British photographer and writer who says he likes to focus on the human side of adventuring, telling stories of climate change, sustainability projects and coping with extreme environments. When his trip to Nepal to chronicle how Everest is being cleaned up in the  Tenzing Everest Challenge  was postponed, he \u201cclimbed the mountain\u201d differently, going up and down, up and down, up and down the steps of his suburban London apartment building. He used a half-flight of the stairs to the second floor because that was all that the camera recording his accomplishment on Zoom could capture. After 24 hours 30 minutes, he had ascended and, of course, descended, the mountain. \u201cBasically,\u201d he said in a phone interview from his suburban London home, \u201cI went up and down eight steps 6,506 times.\u201d  Read more  here . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that President Trump has been \u201can agent of distraction\u201d during the response to the coronavirus pandemic and questioned his commitment to testing for the disease in a blistering assessment of his performance. \u201cThe fact is the president refuses to accept evidence, data, truth and the rest. We must insist on the truth,\u201d Pelosi said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to test, because he doesn\u2019t want to know the numbers, probably. Or he just doesn\u2019t accept the science of it.\u201d Her comments marked the latest escalation in a war of words between the Democratic speaker and Republican president, who has characterized Pelosi as a \u201csick puppy\u201d in response to previous criticism of his handling of the pandemic. On Wednesday, Pelosi argued that Trump has created distractions that have hindered the federal response, including his plan to issue an executive order halting immigration and his support for people protesting state-level stay-at-home orders. \u201cI wish the president instead of being an agent of distraction \u2026 would frankly just grow up to the fact that we have a big challenge in our country,\u201d Pelosi said. In dealing with the crisis, Pelosi said Trump \u201cwas not properly prepared, not with the truth, not with the facts or the admission of what was happening in our country. Delay, denial, death.\u201d During her appearance, Pelosi also blamed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for a delay in passing a bill that will provide additional loans to small businesses impacted by the outbreak. Democrats have insisted that the bill also include funding for hospitals and testing \u2014 something Pelosi argued Republicans took too long to accept. \u201cThat took them a couple of weeks, but they finally did,\u201d she said.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) sued the Chinese government and the ruling Communist Party on Tuesday, making his state the first to seek damages from China over its \u201cappalling campaign of deceit, concealment, misfeasance, and inaction,\u201d which he says unleashed the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,\u201d Schmitt said in a  statement  announcing the lawsuit. \u201cThey must be held accountable for their actions.\u201d Read more  here . Standing in front of an empty storefront along Main Street, Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman (I) was beaming with hopeful optimism, believing businesses would make it through the  coronavirus  pandemic. On Tuesday, it became apparent what the mayor might have had in mind. She said she wants to open up the casinos, assuming 100 percent of the population are carriers of the novel coronavirus. Let them, and visitors, gather and gamble, smoke in confined spaces, touch slot machines all day \u2014 and let the chips \u2014 and apparently the infections \u2014 fall where they may. Read more  here . Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said states could start increasing their testing capabilities as soon as this week, with at-home test kits part of the overall effort. In a Wednesday interview with \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Hahn said the new at-home test kits can detect the presence of the novel coronavirus and are as effective as tests administered in a doctor\u2019s office. Users can go online and answer a questionnaire about their symptoms. If the symptoms meet FDA guidelines for the virus, a package with a swab and saline solution will be sent in the mail overnight, he said. The user can mail the sample overnight and get results from LabCorp soon after, Hahn said. The at-home tests will first be provided to health-care workers and front-line responders to the virus, but they are factored into helping states increase the number of people they test, he said. While the new test brings much promise, Hahn said the estimated time for a vaccine is still March 2021. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated said the United States could double its testing because of home-kits. The kits are part of an overall increase in testing. President Trump said Wednesday that he will sign his previously announced executive order to halt immigration by the end of the day, a move he has said is intended to help Americans return to work who have lost jobs amid the coronavirus crisis. The order, administration officials say, will curb immigration to the United States for 60 days, a freeze that will block green-card recipients from moving to the country but will continue to allow temporary workers on nonimmigrant visas to enter. \u201cI will be signing my Executive Order prohibiting immigration into our Country today,\u201d Trump said in a morning tweet, in which he also touted other steps he has taken with the aim of restricting immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump first shared his plans for the executive order in a late-night tweet on Monday, which sent White House officials scrambling Tuesday to work through details. At a White House briefing late Tuesday afternoon, Trump said the order was still being written and he would \u201cprobably\u201d sign it Wednesday. Trump\u2019s plans have prompted an array of reaction from Democrats, many of whom argue it is a distraction from the federal response to the pandemic. While immigration has already significantly slowed during the crisis, other critics have said it sends a troubling signal during a global pandemic. Read more  here . Wisconsin\u2019s top Republican lawmakers filed  a lawsuit  Tuesday to block a statewide stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Tony Evers (D), escalating political tensions in the state over how to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Evers and his administration extended restrictions through May 26 and closed schools through the end of the year, warning that reopening too early could result in a spike of cases. But Robin Vos, speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, and state Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader, said in  a statement  Tuesday that the governor\u2019s orders went beyond the bounds of the law and have created \u201cimmense frustration.\u201d  \u201cThe governor has denied the people a voice through this unprecedented administrative overreach,\u201d they said. \u201cWisconsinites deserve certainty, transparency and a plan to end the constant stream of executive orders that are eroding both the economy and their liberty.\u201d  Their lawsuit seeks to deny Andrea Palm, the state\u2019s top health official, the ability to make unilateral decisions during public health emergencies and require her to gain legislative approval first. Their suit accused her of laying claim \u201cto a suite of czar-like powers.\u201d  Evers said the lawsuit could cost lives by lifting rules in place to ensure public health,  telling  the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \u201cPolitical power should not trump life.\u201d  The lawsuit bypasses lower courts and instead goes straight to the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives. Earlier this month, that court ordered the state to proceed with primary elections on April 7, after Wisconsin\u2019s Republican legislators had insisted on opening polls. The move left hundreds of masked voters standing in line for hours, including several in Milwaukee who have tested positive since then,  the city\u2019s health officials said  Tuesday. European governments have approved potential covid-19 vaccines for live human testing, and some trials are slated to begin as early as this week. Experts disagree on the likelihood of finding a successful vaccine anytime soon for the disease caused by the coronavirus, with many pointing to early signs of what may be only a short-lived immunity from the virus for those who have already caught it. That said, governments are racing to find an effective way to vaccinate against the disease, which has caused a global pandemic and a subsequent economic shutdown. They are also racing to be the first. According to British Health Secretary Matt Hancock, work on a potential vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Oxford will begin as early as Thursday. Hancock announced that the British government will provide nearly $25 million to the Oxford team and an additional $28 million to another team working on a separate vaccine at Imperial College London. \u201cIn normal times, reaching this stage would take years, and I\u2019m very proud of the work taken place so far,\u201d Hancock said Tuesday at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. \u201cAfter all, the upside to being the first country in the world to develop a successful vaccine is so huge that I am throwing everything at it,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, the German government\u2019s vaccine regulator gave the green light to the testing of a potential vaccine developed by the German biotech company BioNTech in conjunction with the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. That vaccine will be initially administered on a sample of 200 healthy people between ages 18 and 55, and it will then be tested on those more at risk for covid-19.

The ads on Facebook sounded populist and passionate: \u201cThe people are rising up against these insane shutdowns,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting back to demand that our elected officials reopen America.\u201d But the posts, funded by an initiative called \u201cConvention of States,\u201d were not the product of a grass-roots uprising alone. Instead, they represented one salvo in a wide-ranging and well-financed conservative campaign to undermine restrictions that medical experts say are necessary to  contain the coronavirus  \u2014 but that protesters call overkill and whose economic fallout could damage President Trump\u2019s political prospects. A network of right-leaning individuals and groups, aided by nimble online outfits, has helped incubate the fervor erupting in state capitals across the country. The activism is often organic and the frustration deeply felt, but it is also being amplified, and in some cases coordinated, by longtime conservative activists, whose robust operations were initially set up with help from Republican megadonors.

By the time the government declared a total lockdown on March 15, the entire country had already shut down in a state of self-induced panic, as the number of cases seemingly soared. Now, two months since that first case, Lebanon has reported just 677 coronavirus infections and 21 deaths. It is far behind (or ahead) of Norway, which is widely regarded as having done a good job of managing the spread of covid-19 and has a slightly smaller population \u2014 5.3 million compared to Lebanon\u2019s 6 million. Norway has more than 7,000 cases and 182 deaths. Read more  here . Organized religions were not built for social distancing. Worshipers in churches, mosques, synagogues and temples from  India  to  South Korea  to  Ukraine  have found themselves unwitting coronavirus vectors. From  Israel  to  Iran  to the  United States , some religious communities have been at the forefront of  resistance to social distancing , especially orders to close or restrict places of worship. Across continents, celebrations around holidays including Easter, Passover, Nowruz and Ramadan, which begins Thursday, have been upended as people forgo communal prayers and rites. In the face of all manner of disruptions and cataclysms, religious practices have adapted and persevered \u2014 and the  coronavirus  pandemic is no different. Rituals worldwide have begun to adapt to a changing way of life. Read more  here . Until recently, the small seaside enclave of Bolinas, Calif., was perhaps best known for its animosity toward the outside world. Accessible only by unmarked roads, the town voted in the 1970s to ban new sewer hookups as a ploy to keep out new arrivals. Now, Bolinas may have a new claim to fame: It will become the first community in the United States to test its entire population for the coronavirus, regardless of symptoms, in a bid to examine how the virus spreads and how antibodies against it are developed. \u201cWhat we need to understand is how does the virus spread through communities so that we know how to open up people\u2019s lives again,\u201d Aenor Sawyer, a researcher at the University of California at San Francisco,  told  NPR. Almost all of Bolinas\u2019s 1,680 residents have registered to undergo two tests at a pop-up center in a local park: one, a swab of the nose to see if they have the virus; and another, a blood test to determine if they have been infected and have developed antibodies against the virus. Sawyer, a longtime resident of Bolinas herself, said it offers an ideal ecosystem for such a study. Sitting atop  grassy hills  north of San Francisco, the unincorporated community has a socioeconomically diverse population, and with a median age of 62, a substantial portion is high-risk, too. Yet it is the town\u2019s resident tech multimillionaires who have forked over the roughly $400,000 necessary to fund the unprecedented study,  according to  the Marin Independent Journal. They were inspired by the Italian town of V\u00f2, near Venice, which managed to control the virus after two rounds of community-wide testing. Starting this weekend, UCSF researchers will launch a companion study in San Francisco\u2019s mostly Latino Mission District, which boasts a more ethnically diverse population in a denser urban setting. Since the  coronavirus  struck the United States, immigration authorities have deported dozens of infected migrants, leaving governments and nonprofit organizations across Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean struggling to respond. When some countries resisted continued deportations, U.S. officials said they would screen migrants slated for removal. But they did not commit to administering coronavirus tests. In many instances, the screenings, which consist primarily of taking a person\u2019s temperature, have failed to detect cases. Officials in the region were concerned about the deportations. Guatemala\u2019s health minister spoke this month of the worrying number of infected deportees sent from the United States \u2014 the \u201cWuhan of the Americas,\u201d he said. Read more  here . ISTANBUL \u2014 A plane carrying a shipment of personal protective medical equipment from Turkey to Britain arrived at a Royal Air Force base northwest of London on Wednesday morning, after days of confusion about why it was delayed. The supplies, which were transported on a Royal Air Force cargo plane, arrived at the RAF Brize Norton base around 3:30 a.m., according to Turkish and British media reports. The shipment was originally due to arrive on Sunday and was supposed to include 400,000 medical gowns that British health workers say they desperately need as stocks of protective equipment have been depleted. The British government was sharply criticized for the delay, although the exact reasons the shipment was held up remain unclear. Turkey has imposed strict export controls on medical equipment during the pandemic. Umit Yalcin, Turkey\u2019s ambassador to Britain, said his government had \u201cno responsibility\u201d for the delay, the Guardian newspaper reported. British officials said 84 tons of equipment were ordered. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the shipment, a commercial order, was being processed and that its contents would be confirmed \u201conce checks have been carried out.\u201d An earlier Turkish shipment arrived at the base on April 10 without difficulty. Acute shortages of protective gear have caused anguish among medical workers and fueled intensifying criticism of the government response to one of the most severe coronavirus outbreaks in the world. The government has said that 61 health workers have died. A separate estimate,  by a nursing organization , said the death toll among health and social care workers has risen to 112 people. A survey of 6,000 medical professionals released Sunday by the  British Medical Association  found that half of doctors working in high-risk environments reported \u201cshortages or no supply of long-sleeved disposable gowns and goggles.\u201d Hassan reported from London.

As hard-hit Italy prepares to gradually lift restrictions, officials in Milan are taking the opportunity to hit the reset button and envision a more environmentally friendly future for their city. Large swaths of the streets will be taken away from cars and turned over to pedestrians and cyclists. \u201cWe worked for years to reduce car use. If everybody drives a car, there is no space for people, there is no space to move, there is no space for commercial activities outside the shops,\u201d Deputy Mayor Marco Granelli told  the Guardian.  \u201cOf course, we want to reopen the economy, but we think we should do it on a different basis from before.\u201d Located in Lombardy, the  epicenter  of Italy\u2019s devastating coronavirus outbreak, Milan has been under strict shelter-at-home orders since early March. Schools and many businesses were forced to close weeks before that. The shutdown caused the number of cars on the road to plummet, and the  smog  hanging over the city all but disappeared, allowing for a clear view of the Alps. Previously on track to become one of the  most polluted cities in Europe,  Milan now hopes that it can keep emissions low as people go back to work. As part of the \u201cStrade Aperte\u201d plan announced this week, roughly 22 miles of streets in the nine-mile-long city will be transformed, with widened sidewalks and bike lanes taking up space once used by cars. Preventing overcrowding on public transit will be crucial for stopping a second wave of infections, Granelli wrote Monday in a  Facebook post.  To discourage driving, the city plans to lower speed limits and give bicyclists and walkers priority on selected streets. The redesign will take place over the summer and has already been widely praised by urbanists and environmentalists who hope to see the model replicated elsewhere. MADRID \u2014 European countries moved ahead at various speeds Wednesday in planning exits from their strict lockdowns. While Austria was already eyeing a reopening of high-risk venues such as bars and restaurants  by the middle of next month , virus-stricken Spain and Italy chose a far slower pace. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez on Wednesday urged parliament to extend a state of emergency until May 9 but promised a \u201cslow and gradual\u201d easing of the restrictions after that date. \u201cWe are living in a time of extraordinary sacrifice,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let our guard down. Today I am asking for the extension as we see what could be a light at the end of the tunnel. We can begin to think of a de-escalation scenario.\u201d  Spain instituted one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns in mid-March, with millions staying at home and no outings even for exercise. Last week, the government let the strictest measure, the \u201chibernation of the economy,\u201d expire after two weeks, sending construction, factory and office workers back to their jobs. As Spaniards clamor to ease restrictions, a storm of criticism exploded Tuesday when some government officials said children would only be allowed out to accompany parents on errands starting next week. Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa backpedaled late Tuesday, saying they were still mapping out the restrictions on the children\u2019s \u201cshort walks.\u201d  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte  had earlier announced plans  for a similarly cautious exit plan from its lockdown. Barring a deterioration of the situation, the country could embark on phase two, which he described as \u201ccoexistence\u201d with the virus, by early May. In Greece \u2014 less ravaged by the virus but hard-hit economically \u2014 the government said it was also working on an exit strategy, but it remained unclear which elements of the lockdown would remain in place  when it was set to end next Monday. Noack reported from Berlin. As Harvard University  faces backlash  for receiving nearly $9 million in stimulus funds from the federal government, the chorus of critics added one prominent member: President Trump. In a tweet late Tuesday, he went after the Ivy League school \u2014 which has a $41 billion endowment, the largest of any educational institution in the world \u2014 for receiving so much federal aid under a formula hastily designed by Congress. \u201cHarvard should give back the money now,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cTheir whole \u2018endowment\u2019 system should be looked at!\u201d  Harvard should give back the money now. Their whole \u201cendowment\u201d system should be looked at!  https://t.co/LcjOcsnCWT An unprecedented, $2.2 trillion aid package passed in late March directed more than $12 billion in federal money to  an emergency relief fund  for thousands of colleges and universities. Harvard alone got an $8.7 million relief check. Under the provisions of the fund, at least half of the money  must be allocated  to emergency financial grants for students. But a spokesperson for the Cambridge, Mass., university  told  Forbes that it would direct all of the funds toward \u201cfinancial assistance for students to meet their urgent needs in the face of this pandemic.\u201d Still, Trump and many others, including late-night host Trevor Noah, questioned why the university was getting such a large cut of the funding \u2014 and why it would choose to keep it. Under the fund, schools received more money for a greater number of low-income students receiving federal aid. The Harvard spokesperson also told Forbes that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of its endowment is restricted to spending designated by donors, although it used nearly $2 billion from the endowment for its operating costs last year. Earlier on Tuesday, the school rejected Trump\u2019s claim at a White House briefing that it had received funds through the Paycheck Protection Program, another federal aid initiative meant to help hard-hit businesses. The president said Harvard would be required to pay back those funds. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Prices for the international oil benchmark Brent crude  dropped to their lowest point since 1999  on Wednesday, falling as low as  $15.98 a barrel in Asian trading. Brent crude had  initially held up  even as U.S. oil prices dramatically fell into negative figures earlier this week, as storage space shrank and demand remained low amid lockdowns in many U.S. states. The dramatic drops earlier this week came immediately before the expiration of oil futures contracts, but they signaled tumultuous times ahead. Wednesday\u2019s drop in Brent crude prices reflected similar considerations but also more global concerns that an OPEC-backed deal to cut global production \u2014 an attempt to prevent prices from falling further \u2014  may not be sufficient. The plummeting U.S. oil prices could prompt the world\u2019s largest producers to take more decisive action, even though analysts said further cuts would be painful and the scenario of Brent crude prices falling into negative territory remained unlikely. After the  plummeting oil prices  took a heavy toll on stocks Tuesday, Asian and European markets were relatively calm Wednesday. U.S. stock futures were up, after President Trump signaled that his administration may aid U.S. oil companies. State governments continued Tuesday to chart differing paths for dealing with the  coronavirus , with some stressing the importance of ongoing restrictions while others moved more quickly toward reopening economic and social activities, at times disregarding White House guidelines. South Carolina, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee and Florida have announced limited easing of business and recreational closures and social gatherings, to start between this week and the end of April. While some of those states have shown a decrease in confirmed virus cases on some recent days, other days have presented increased numbers. None has charted the sustained, 14-day \u201cdownward trajectory\u201d outlined in federal guidelines issued last week. Read more  here . Unknown activists have posted nearly 25,000 email addresses and passwords allegedly belonging to the National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, the Gates Foundation and other groups working to combat the  coronavirus  pandemic, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online extremism and terrorist groups. While SITE was unable to verify whether the email addresses and passwords were authentic, the group said the information was released Sunday and Monday and almost immediately used to foment attempts at hacking and harassment by far-right extremists. An Australian cybersecurity expert, Robert Potter, said he was able to verify that the WHO email addresses and passwords were real. Read more  here . Thirty-three crew members aboard a cruise ship docked in Japan have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Wednesday. The Italian-flagged Costa Atlantica has been undergoing repairs in Nagasaki since January, when plans to travel to China were scrapped due to the virus,  according to Japan\u2019s Kyodo News Service . Though no passengers were on board, 623 workers remained on the vessel. Several members of the crew subsequently reported symptoms of covid-19, Nagasaki\u2019s mayor, Tomihisa Taue,  told reporters . After the first crew member tested positive on Tuesday, local officials tested an additional 57 others who may have been exposed to the virus. More than half of those tests came back positive. None of the crew members who tested positive are in serious condition, and all are being isolated in single-occupancy rooms,  officials said on Wednesday.  According to Kyodo, several hundred other crew members are still on the ship, and being housed in cabins with balconies. Japan has seen a  surge  in coronavirus infections in recent weeks, and it  remains unclear  if anyone boarded or disembarked the cruise ship after the first case in Nagasaki Prefecture was reported in mid-March. Nagasaki\u2019s governor, Hodo Nakamura,  asked  the central government for help on Wednesday, saying the prefecture lacked the resources to test everyone on board the ship and separate healthy crew members from those who have contracted the virus. Authorities plan to keep crew members who test positive but display only mild symptoms on the boat for monitoring,  according to Reuters.  Those who test negative will be sent back to their home countries. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to follow major developments in the pandemic.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen  apologized to the public on Wednesday  over a growing coronavirus outbreak among navy sailors, after the island\u2019s Defense Minister Yen Teh-fa said he was willing to resign over shortcomings that led to the cluster. On Saturday,  reports emerged  that several Taiwanese sailors who last month participated in a friendship visit to the Pacific nation of Palau had been confirmed to be infected with the virus. The more than 700 sailors who traveled to Palau disembarked in Taiwan after completing mandatory quarantine and passing medical checks, officials said, but only days later the first infections were confirmed. There are at least 27 confirmed cases, amid fears of a second wave of infections on the island. Officials have acknowledged some disease-control rules were not properly followed during the visit. The new cases shattered cautious optimism that Taiwan may have won the battle with coronavirus.  For three days last week , it had reported zero new cases, putting it on course to secure its spot as a global role model in combating the virus. Despite a population of around 24 million and its proximity to China, the self-ruled island of Taiwan has only confirmed  425 coronavirus cases  and six deaths. Taiwan said its authorities were racing to trace the contacts of the infected sailors who returned from Palau and had sent phone alerts to 200,000 individuals who may have been exposed. The Taiwanese cases added to global concerns that preliminary success at curbing or stopping the spread of the coronavirus may easily be derailed. Given its relatively long incubation period, a single cluster of coronavirus cases can threaten to undo months of progress within a short time if it goes initially unnoticed. Other places that were originally heralded as role models, such as  Singapore , are also seeing surges in new cases after failing to contain clusters. Congressional Republicans have strongly backed President Trump\u2019s efforts to respond to the deadly  coronavirus  pandemic and its crippling impact on the economy. But on the issue of testing, some Senate Republicans are looking for ways to get the federal government to play a bigger role despite Trump\u2019s insistence it is an issue that  governors should handle . Led by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Senate Republicans have largely envisioned the federal government taking a lead role in experimenting with diagnostic and serological tests for  the coronavirus , even if some of the ideas ultimately fail \u2014 the thinking being that the government can take chances that perhaps the private sector cannot. Read more  here . It was bound to happen. Ever since he announced his run for the White House in 2015, President Trump has taken  the country on a nativist spiral . At times,  Trump\u2019s more well-heeled allies  argued that his repeated demonization of immigrants was just a sop to a hard-line nationalist base. But in the midst of a deadly pandemic \u2014 and in the last year of his term \u2014  Trump is back to what he seems to know best . On Tuesday, it seemed the White House was on the cusp of issuing an executive order that  suspends immigration into the United States  for at least the next 60 days. The move is an unprecedented extension of  Trump\u2019s restrictionist agenda . But it remained unclear who exactly would fall afoul of the new directive, especially when international travel has drastically dropped as a result of coronavirus lockdowns. Read more  here . Faced with a mounting coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese city of Harbin has banned everyone except for locals from residential zones,  Reuters  reported Tuesday. Vehicles that aren\u2019t registered locally are also forbidden from entering. The city of over 10 million is the capital of Heilongjiang province, which has emerged as a new battleground in the fight against the virus in recent weeks. The province is located in the northeast of China, close to the Russian border, and a surge of new cases has been attributed to travelers returning home from Russia after the number of infections in China stabilized. Before enacting the new restrictions, Harbin had already instituted mandatory isolation periods for people returning from known hot spots or abroad. Some central areas returned to a state of lockdown, and 18 local officials were penalized for failing to prevent the outbreak, the  Financial Times  reported. A makeshift hospital was erected in the border city of Suifenhe, and three planeloads of medical equipment were flown there from Wuhan, highlighting how authorities\u2019 focus had shifted. The move to seal off residential areas comes as China reports a slight uptick in new cases, following a period in which the infection rate appeared to level off. The country\u2019s National Health Commission said Wednesday that 30 new confirmed cases had been reported over the past 24 hours, an increase from the previous day, when only 11 were recorded. Of the new cases, 23 involved people returning from abroad. The other seven were all found in Heilongjiang province. The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China tracks separately, also rose to 42. The previous day, 37 asymptomatic cases were reported. LONDON \u2014 During the British Parliament\u2019s long and loquacious debates, the green leather benches in the House of Commons are usually packed with lawmakers, sitting cheek by jowl, shouting and sputtering at one another. The pandemic has stopped all of this close talking. Imperial College epidemiologist Neil Ferguson noted how particularly germy the Houses of Parliament are. Strict measures to enforce social distancing have essentially shut down the place in recent weeks. On Tuesday, a handful of lawmakers returned from their Easter break to approve the continuation of democracy via a \u201c virtual Parliament ,\u201d a remarkable and unanimous vote to overturn the way things have been done here for over 700 years, and to keep on arguing \u2014 but at a proper distance.

South Korea President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday announced a $32 billion aid package for businesses that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, such as aviation, shipping and car manufacturing. The infusion of cash is intended to forestall the need to lay off employees, and ensure that struggling companies weather the crisis, South Korea\u2019s semiofficial Yonhap News Agency  reported . Moon also urged his economic council to push for a New Deal-style program that would create thousands of new jobs by putting unemployed people to work on national infrastructure projects. At Wednesday\u2019s meeting with his economic policy team, Moon also announced that an emergency aid package intended to give companies more liquidity would be expanded from $81 billion to $109 billion,  Reuters  reported. People who recently lost freelance or temporary jobs would be eligible for a three-month subsidy equivalent to about $400 a month. \u201cKeeping jobs is the core part of coping with this national crisis and the most pressing issue related to survival,\u201d Moon said Wednesday.

At least two people who died in early February had contracted the novel coronavirus, health officials in California said Tuesday, signaling that the virus may have spread \u2014 and claimed lives \u2014 in the United States weeks earlier than previously thought. Tissue samples taken from two individuals who died in Santa Clara County, Calif., tested positive for the virus, local health officials  said in a statement . One of the victims died on Feb. 6, and the other died on Feb. 17. Initially, the nation\u2019s earliest coronavirus fatality was believed to have occurred on Feb. 29, in Kirkland, Wash., a suburb of Seattle that rapidly became a hotspot. In March, health officials there linked two Feb. 26 deaths to covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Yet the Santa Clara County fatalities still push the toll of the virus back by weeks. Both of those deaths occurred while federal officials had tightly restricted tests to people with a known travel history and specific symptoms, authorities said. Tests on the victims could not be performed until the medical examiner performed autopsies. These two fatalities, along with a third on March 6, also indicate that the coronavirus was likely spreading earlier and further in the San Francisco Bay area than previously thought. Santa Clara County\u2019s first locally transmitted case of the virus was  reported  Feb. 28, in 68-year-old  Azar Ahrabi , who later became the region\u2019s first death in March. But test results for the two earlier deaths show that the coronavirus had in fact killed someone in the county, which includes the city of San Jose as well as Silicon Valley, more than a month before Ahrabi died. The Bay Area became an early hot spot for the virus at the beginning of March, when reported cases were in the double digits and outbreaks were believed to be mostly concentrated on the West Coast. Earlier this year, a genetic analysis of virus samples found that the virus may have also spread undetected for weeks in Washington state, which reported the country\u2019s first two deaths. Georgia\u2019s top cosmetology regulator said she is \u201cvery happy\u201d about an order allowing the state\u2019s barber shops and salons to reopen later this week. But she\u2019s not letting them do so without safety measures in place. As the state becomes the first to  lift restrictions  on a wide range of businesses on Friday, the Georgia State Board of Cosmetology and Barbers on Tuesday released  a list of social distancing recommendations  to curb the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cUnder our sanitation laws and rules, we are charged with the responsibility of protecting consumers from the spread of contagious diseases everyday in our salons,\u201d Kay Kendrick, the board\u2019s chair, said in a statement. Under the guidelines, \u201cour professionals will be able to do an even better job of protecting themselves and their clients.\u201d  According to the recommendations, salons and barber shops should screen and take the temperatures of employees and clients before they enter stores, while limiting the number of people inside by scheduling appointments in advance. Store owners should institute social distancing measures for those who are inside, including training staff, and implementing the use of personal protective equipment and divider shields. Kendrick said that most of the 95,000 licensed salons and spas overseen by the board are independent contractors with no other income. Several business  surveyed by the Associated Press  may not be opening anytime soon, they told the news agency, to protect themselves and their clients. At a White House briefing earlier in the day, Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus response director, said hairdressers and barbers would have to get creative to stay safe while serving their customers. Thousands of new coronavirus cases in Singapore \u2014 and almost 70 percent of the city\u2019s total \u2014 are concentrated in dormitories that house migrant workers, who have been locked down in their quarters as authorities seek a solution. The situation highlights the vulnerability of migrant workers, who in Singapore make up  one-third of the labor force . Their risks of infection are exacerbated by overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination. In Singapore, critics say these events have revealed a hubris among the authorities and the wider community, who took for granted their  initial success  in keeping infection numbers low while failing to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak among the most downtrodden.

The Senate passed a $484 billion deal Tuesday to replenish a small-business loan program that has been overrun by demand and to devote more money to hospitals and  coronavirus  testing. President Trump said he would sign it into law. The legislation, which came together over days of intense negotiation that followed a bitter partisan standoff, would increase funding for the Paycheck Protection Program by $310 billion. It would also boost a separate small-business emergency grant and loan program by $60 billion, and direct $75 billion to hospitals and $25 billion to a new coronavirus testing program. The House is expected to approve the measure Thursday. Read more  here .",

    "title": "Coronavirus Crisis Offers Taiwan a Chance to Push Back Against China - The New York Times",
    "text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 They are sending millions of masks, emblazoned with the words \u201cmade in Taiwan,\u201d to the United States, Italy and other countries hit hard by the coronavirus. They are denouncing Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the World Health Organization. They are flaunting celebrity endorsements and creating hashtags like #TaiwanCanHelp. Officials in Taiwan are attempting to turn their success in battling the coronavirus at home into a geopolitical win. Taiwan is competing with China on pandemic aid diplomacy in defiance of Beijing\u2019s efforts to isolate the self-ruled democratic island that it claims as its own. The island is promoting itself as a model of democracy to try to undercut China\u2019s  own campaign  to use the crisis to  tout the strength of its authoritarian system . The world is responding. American and European officials have praised Taiwan\u2019s donations of more than 10 million masks. Politicians, business leaders and celebrities, including  Bill Gates  and  Barbra Streisand , have hailed the island as exemplary in its fight against the coronavirus. \u201cWe can see that this is a good opportunity for us to let people know that Taiwan is a good global citizen,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s vice president, Chen Chien-jen, said this week in an interview in Taipei. \u201cWe have to fight for our participation.\u201d Taiwan, with a population of 23 million, has reported 426 cases of coronavirus and six deaths as of Wednesday, far fewer than many countries. The island  stands out  for having avoided painful and costly lockdowns by moving quickly to impose travel restrictions, screen visitors and deploy protective gear that it had stockpiled for years. Taiwan has even been able to continue with its baseball season, albeit without the crowds, holding its opening game this month. [Analysis:  What will our post-virus normal feel like? Hints are beginning to emerge .] Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic and public relations campaign is drawing fire from Beijing, which has  dismissed  the effort as an attempt to \u201cseek independence under the pretext of the pandemic.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s push for greater global recognition has in large part been an effort to raise questions about the cost of China\u2019s campaign to isolate the island diplomatically. China has worked to shut Taiwan out of groups like the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency, denying it access to scientific briefings and emergency meetings. Mr. Chen, the vice president, said that Taiwan had been \u201cleft as an orphan\u201d because of China.  \u201cNo country can fight Covid-19 alone,\u201d said Mr. Chen, an epidemiologist by training. He said the island wanted \u201ca chance to share our knowledge and experience and our technologies with other countries.\u201d While Taiwan\u2019s push for a greater voice in the health agency has drawn supportive comments from officials in the United States, Japan, Canada and elsewhere, experts say it is unlikely to result in any immediate breakthroughs. The W.H.O. has said that the question of Taiwan\u2019s membership in the agency is up to member states, not the W.H.O.\u2019s leaders, and that it has allowed Taiwan to participate in trainings and research conferences related to the virus. The debate over Taiwan\u2019s exclusion has at times been heated. The director-general of the W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, facing criticism from the Trump administration and others that he is too deferential to China, has accused Taiwan of unleashing racist attacks against him online. Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, has rejected Dr. Tedros\u2019s claims and her government has said that the online attacks were coordinated by Beijing. The island wants to push a simple message: \u201cTaiwan Can Help.\u201d But underlying it is a multifaceted effort to challenge Beijing in the realm of coronavirus aid diplomacy. Beijing hopes that deliveries of masks, ventilators and other aid to countries hit hard by the pandemic will help reshape the narrative and deflect from questions about how its  initial efforts to conceal it  made the pandemic worse. Taiwan, a major manufacturer of masks and other hospital equipment, is offering an alternative source of aid \u2014 and winning accolades for its response. On Tuesday, for instance, the foreign minister of Lithuania praised Taiwan\u2019s donations as a \u201cgenuine act of solidarity.\u201d Taiwan has even sought to use the pandemic to promote its manufacturing prowess, pledging to  export mask-making machines  by early August. More broadly, Taiwan has tapped into rising concerns around the world about the costs of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s penchant for secrecy. In contrast, Taiwan has presented its government as one that exudes confidence as it welcomes civic participation and the scrutiny of the press. When China last month expelled reporters from three American news organizations, including The New York Times, Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, sought to use the opportunity to burnish Taiwan\u2019s credentials as  a bastion of free speech . On Twitter, he welcomed the reporters to move to Taiwan, \u201ca country that is a beacon of freedom & democracy.\u201d Even Ms. Tsai, the president, has adopted a more public diplomatic strategy, casting aside her usual approach of working behind the scenes in reaching out to foreign leaders. She has in recent days traded messages of encouragement on Twitter with Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Such conversations, which have been widely shared on social media sites, represent the kind of public leader-to-leader exchanges that China has long sought to prevent. In December 2016, for example, China denounced Ms. Tsai\u2019s  congratulatory phone call  to Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect. There are risks in Taiwan\u2019s campaign. Chinese officials were already angered when, in the early days of the epidemic, Taiwan shut its borders to visitors from the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, and imposed a ban on the export of masks. The island could further antagonize China at a time when the ruling Communist Party is pushing through hard-line actions, including mass  surveillance  efforts in the mainland and a  crackdown  on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. Beijing has shown no signs of easing its aggression toward Taiwan, despite the pandemic, sending warships into the waters off its coast. Some commentators in China have threatened economic punishment if the island continues making diplomatic overtures. Chinese officials have accused Taiwan of working to \u201cmake reckless political maneuvers and hype up\u201d its participation in global organizations. \u201cTheir scheme will never succeed,\u201d Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said this month at a news conference in Beijing. Now some in Taiwan worry that Beijing might more severely restrict trade with the island. \u201cPolitically, we want to keep a distance. But economically it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Alex Chiang, a retired professor of diplomacy at National Chengchi University in Taipei. \u201cAfter the Covid crisis is over, we still have to go to China and cooperate with Chinese businesspeople in order to get economic recovery started.\u201d Mainland analysts argue that Taiwan\u2019s moves to assert itself will worsen tensions between China and the United States. China is already upset that President Trump last month signed legislation aimed at discouraging Taiwan\u2019s few remaining diplomatic allies from cutting ties with the island under pressure from Beijing. \u201cThis will increase conflicts or even confrontations between China and U.S.,\u201d said Zhang Wensheng, associate dean at the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University in eastern China. Taiwan\u2019s citizens say they are trying to ignore the mainland\u2019s threats. Many have in recent days joined the effort to raise the island\u2019s profile, helping spread hashtags like #TaiwanCanHelp and organizing crowdfunding campaigns to buy advertisements in Western news outlets highlighting the island\u2019s successes. \u201cWho can isolate Taiwan?\u201d said a  website  they started. \u201cNo one.\u201d Albee Zhang and Wang Yiwei contributed research.",

The five-week total  for jobless claims  passed 26 million , after another 4.4 million people filed claims last week. One international economist called the figures \u201ceye-watering.\u201d The economic crisis has intensified the debate over whether to start lifting coronavirus restrictions and get Americans back to work. And it has raised worries about the full scope of the numbers, amid states\u2019 lags in handling the claims. Above, an unemployment office in Fayetteville, Ark. In Florida, that is especially true. Our reporters looked at what being fired is like in  one of the slowest states to process jobless claims . The Times is providing free access to  much of our coronavirus coverage , and our  Coronavirus Briefing newsletter  \u2014 like all of our newsletters \u2014 is free.

President Trump is expected to sign it quickly.  The latest round of aid will also give more funding to hospitals and testing. It does not include money for state governments, something the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, made clear he did not want. He even  suggested states should be allowed to file for bankruptcy . Above, Speaker Nancy Pelosi arriving for the votes.  The House also voted today to create a  special committee to investigate  the Trump administration\u2019s pandemic response and its spending of federal aid packages. 3. One of every five  New York City residents who were  tested for antibodies  to the new coronavirus was positive. Above, a testing site in Brooklyn this week. The preliminary test results, made public by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday, could mean that the virus spread far more widely than is known. It also raises the prospect that many New Yorkers who never knew they were infected \u2014 up to 2.7 million, according to Mr. Cuomo \u2014 have already encountered the virus and survived. The city\u2019s top official for disease control warned that the results were not reliable, and that there is not enough research about immunity in coronavirus survivors. In other developments: By the time the U.S. confirmed early cases of the virus,  thousands of infections had invisibly spread in several major cities , new research suggests. Nearly all hospitalized Covid-19 patients  had at least one chronic health issue , according to a study of thousands of New York patients, and nearly 88 percent had at least two. 4. \u201cLet us not squander what we have achieved.\u201d That was Chancellor Angela Merkel speaking to the governors of Germany\u2019s 16 states. She warned that loosening coronavirus lockdown rules without extreme caution  could result in a surge of new cases . The government is allowing some schools and small stores to reopen on Monday. \u201cNobody wants to hear this, but the truth is that we are not living in the final phase of this pandemic, but at the beginning,\u201d she said. Much of Europe is looking across the Atlantic at the U.S.  with disbelief at its handling of the pandemic , our Berlin bureau chief writes. Rather than American exceptionalism, America \u201chas done exceptionally badly,\u201d one political scientist said. 5. Ramadan Kareem! Muslims observing the holy month might be missing the daily rituals and \u201cbeautiful chaos of a community in constant motion,\u201d writes Wajahat Ali in our Opinion section. Above, a man prayed in Istanbul on Wednesday. But this year,  staying at home and trying your best  might just be enough. \u201cIt won\u2019t be heroic or extraordinary, but during these challenging times, it will be enough,\u201d he writes. In Pakistan, Muslims are allowed to go to mosques if they follow strict rules and keep a distance. But the government\u2019s giving in to clerics has  critics worrying about who is in charge  during the country\u2019s crisis. 6. No pools, no day camps, no summer school. That\u2019s  what the summer looks like  for New York City\u2019s 1.1 million students, who are used to spending the summer at pools, beaches and parks, or in cultural or job programs. The collapse of the city\u2019s summer offerings because of the coronavirus means a lot more boredom and continued suffering for New York\u2019s children \u2014 especially for poor and homeless children and students with disabilities. In our new  Quarantine Diaries series , we paid a virtual visit to a family of eight in their three-bedroom apartment in the South Bronx. 7. Climate projects  in a host of American cities  are on pause for the coronavirus . Sea walls in San Francisco, Miami Beach, above, and New York City are facing delays. Officials across the country are pressured to turn their focuses to the virus, redirecting money away from infrastructure projects that will have long-term effects. It risks tackling one crisis at the expense of another. \u201cNatural disasters won\u2019t wait until this pandemic has run its course,\u201d one flood-preparedness expert said. And if you\u2019ve been keeping up with our Earth Day coverage for the holiday\u2019s 50th anniversary,  join us for a live video call  on Friday at 11:30 a.m. Eastern with our climate journalist John Schwartz as he speaks with the first organizer of Earth Day and young climate leaders. 8. The N.F.L. draft  starts tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern, and it will be a throwback to simpler times. Instead of a flashy event held on The Strip in Las Vegas for some 50,000 fans, it will be a purely televised draft with players participating remotely. As in recent years, quarterbacks like Joe Burrow, above, and wide receivers are expected to take center stage. Here\u2019s  how to watch and what to expect . Toby Gerhart, a former N.F.L. running back, reflected on a draft day five years ago that began the end of his 22-year career. He shares  lessons he learned  for athletes who have had their dreams spoiled by the pandemic this year. 9. There are Yankees fans, above, and there are Red Sox fans,  and neither the two shall mix. Nor will their pigeons. At the genomic level, a new study finds, there are  two giant interconnected groupings of pigeons  that breed with one another, one in New England and one south of Connecticut to Virginia. Connecticut is the boundary between them: Think of them as two pigeon genetic megacities. In other animal news, a team of researchers found the first frog fossil from Antarctica, raising the possibility that frogs from warmer climates in South America  moved through Antarctica . 10. And finally,  songs of hope. Hospitals around the New York area have adopted anthems like the Beatles\u2019 \u201cHere Comes the Sun,\u201d Jay-Z and Alicia Keys\u2019s \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d or \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d to  celebrate patients\u2019 victories in the battle against the coronavirus . The victories differ \u2014 from getting off life support or a ventilator to being discharged \u2014 but the purpose is the same: an anthem of affirmation for the medical professionals and a tribute to the resilience of the patients.
